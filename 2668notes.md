## 26/1 Controlling the Past/Archaeology, History, Colonialism, and Magic Meet in Egypt
Auguste Mariette (Fr)
- 1850
- Louvre purchaser
- founds Antiquities Service, Cairo Museum

Heinrich Schliemann (Gr)
- 1870
- discovered Troy and stratigraphy - excavation by layers to keep sense of time

William Flinders Petrie (Eng)
- 1880
- pyramidologist (sent to measure Great Pyramid)
- pioneered Egyptian stratigraphic archaeology

colonial powers try to amass collections
- image of being the civilization that pro
- motivations:
	* political and military influences
	* profit
	* historical artifact
	* cofirmation of Bible/other texts

## 29/1 Steps to Egyptology/ Exploring, Collecting
### Archaeology
- less colonial now - cooperative/joint projects
- local population has more say
- more professional: scientific methods, inquisitive, rather than acquisitive
	* publish findings
	* peer-reviewed journals
- sites are protected
- record position of everything bc archaeology is destruction
- excavations with stratigraphic controls
	* layers of occupation (strata) carefully exposed
	* 100 yrs thick or 1 season in a year

### 3 Steps to Archaeology in ANE and Egypt
1\. Exploration, including travel (5th-17th century)
- 5th c BC Herodotous, Greek historian of Persian Wars
- 3rd c CE Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, Onomasticon, list of place-names
- 4th c CE Queen Helena's pilgrimmage, Imp. Contantine's mother
- 7th c. Arab explorers going beyond Ptolemy's geography, Strabo
- 9th c. Caliph al-Ma'mun penetrates the pyramids for treasure rather than knowledge
	* vinegar and battering ram - hole still used for tourists
- 12th c. CE Al-idrisi produce maps based on works of the ancient Greeks
- 13th c. CE Yaqut al-Hamavi writes Mujam al-Buldan
	* worked his way out of slavery as merchant's assistant & became scholar
	* foundational work in encyclopedic geography
    * copied into 6 vol. German in 17th c, stimulating travel later
- 1480, 1483 German friar Felix Fabri /Wanderings/ to Palestine and Egypt
	* non-scientific travel log, with personal notes on places and people
- 1400-1700 at least 200 accounts of pilgrimmages to Egypt and Palestine
- 1505 during renaissance Hor-Apollo's Hieroglyphica published (coneceived during 5th c)
	* mistakenly believed that hieroglyphs were magic symbols for natural and moral principles "symbology"
	* held back actual deciphering

2\. Collecting (17th-19th century)
- Private: _antiquarianism_ or amateur archaeology
	* 17th c. Pietro della Valle, collecting Coptic (ancient Egyptian language written in Greek script) manuscripts in Egypt
	* 1646 John Greaves /Pyramidographica/ Mis-measured Khufu pyramid as 152m high
	* 1800 "pyramid inch" theory of Joyn Taylor: sides of great pyramid = 36,524 'pyramid inches' - days in a solar year
	* *disproved by Petrie in 1880
- public: museum collecting

3\. Archaeology/Egyptology (scientific, 19th century to present)
