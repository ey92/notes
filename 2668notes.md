# Introduction
## 24-26/1
**sedentism** - emergence of farming, village life

monarchy/kingship
- power acquisition and maintenance
- legitimacy

empire - Why do states expand and how is it legitimized?
collapse: failure of divine kingship

What is civilization?
- art, architecture, religion, writing
- power
- magic act, images,texts, rituals


## 26/1 Controlling the Past/Archaeology, History, Colonialism, and Magic Meet in Egypt
Auguste Mariette (Fr)
- 1850
- Louvre purchaser
- founds Antiquities Service, Cairo Museum

Heinrich Schliemann (Gr)
- 1870
- discovered Troy and stratigraphy - excavation by layers to keep sense of time

William Flinders Petrie (Eng)
- 1880
- pyramidologist (sent to measure Great Pyramid)
- pioneered Egyptian stratigraphic archaeology

colonial powers try to amass collections
- image of being the civilization that pro
- motivations:
	* political and military influences
	* profit
	* historical artifact
	* cofirmation of Bible/other texts

# Discovery & Development of Egyptology
## Steps to Egyptology/ Exploring, Collecting
### Archaeology
- less colonial now - cooperative/joint projects
- local population has more say
- more professional: scientific methods, inquisitive, rather than acquisitive
	* publish findings
	* peer-reviewed journals
- sites are protected
- record position of everything bc archaeology is destruction
- excavations with stratigraphic controls
	* layers of occupation (strata) carefully exposed
	* 100 yrs thick or 1 season in a year

### 3 Steps to Archaeology in ANE and Egypt
#### 1\. Exploration, including travel (5th-17th century)
- 5th c BC Herodotous, Greek historian of Persian Wars
- 3rd c CE Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, Onomasticon, list of place-names
- 4th c CE Queen Helena's pilgrimmage, Imp. Contantine's mother
- 7th c. Arab explorers going beyond Ptolemy's geography, Strabo
- 9th c. Caliph al-Ma'mun penetrates the pyramids for treasure rather than knowledge
	* vinegar and battering ram - hole still used for tourists
- 12th c. CE Al-idrisi produce maps based on works of the ancient Greeks
- 13th c. CE Yaqut al-Hamavi writes Mujam al-Buldan
	* worked his way out of slavery as merchant's assistant & became scholar
	* foundational work in encyclopedic geography
    * copied into 6 vol. German in 17th c, stimulating travel later
- 1480, 1483 German friar Felix Fabri /Wanderings/ to Palestine and Egypt
	* non-scientific travel log, with personal notes on places and people
- 1400-1700 at least 200 accounts of pilgrimmages to Egypt and Palestine
- 1505 during renaissance Hor-Apollo's Hieroglyphica published (coneceived during 5th c)
	* mistakenly believed that hieroglyphs were magic symbols for natural and moral principles "symbology"
	* held back actual deciphering

#### 2\. Collecting (17th-19th century)
- Private: _antiquarianism_ or amateur archaeology
	* 17th c. Pietro della Valle, collecting Coptic (ancient Egyptian language written in Greek script) manuscripts in Egypt
	* 1646 John Greaves /Pyramidographica/ Mis-measured Khufu pyramid as 152m high
	* 1800 "pyramid inch" theory of Joyn Taylor: sides of great pyramid = 36,524 'pyramid inches' - days in a solar year
	* *disproved by Petrie in 1880
    * 1751 Frederik Norden's illustrated travelogues, bestseller, inaccurate
- public: nationalistic, museum collecting
    * France & GB competing to the Indian Ocean fastest 18th-19th century
    * 1798 Napoleon wants to open Suez Canal/Port Said for strategic advantages & invades Egypt
        - found Rosetta Stone, decree of Ptolemy V: hieroglyphic, demotic, greek
        - Thomas Young guessed cartouche (cartridge) represented monarch's name
        - savants illustrated landmarks in Description de l'Egypte (1809-30)
    * 1799-1808 Admiral Nelson evicts French & British Museum gets Rosetta Stone
    * 1822-36 Jean-Francois Champollion deciphers hieroglyphs via rubbing (copy)
        - phonetic and logographic principles, debunk symbology & produce grammar
        - 1936 College du France 1st Chairman of first Egyptology Department
    * Europeans 'going native'/orientalism
    * 1815-22 Giovanni Belzoni 'Patagonian Samson', Italian ex-pat turned circus performer collecting for the British
        discovered Seti I's tomb
    * 1850s Auguste Mariette, Frenchman collecting for Louvre, founds Egyptian Antiquities Service and Cairo Museum

#### 3\. Archaeology/Egyptology (scientific, 19th century to present)
- 1833,63 Charles Lyell, /Principles of Geology/ and /Geological evidences of the antiquity of man?
    - gradual evolutionary change rather than catastrophic Biblical change
    - geological layers, gradual change, law of superposition (top layers are later than lower layers)
    - 1859 Darwin

# Chronology and Cosmology
## 2/2 Cultural Ecology
- Egypt is a gift of the Nile - small area of fertile land around Nile within a desert
- length 4180 mi, Egypt is lower 750mi (1st cataract to delta)
- 1-11 mi wide, usually 1 mi; flow 1-4 knots downstream; travel ~ 2 weeks or months
- schedule and seasons
    -   | Name | Months | Activity |
        | ---- | ------ | -------- |
        | Akhet | Jun - Oct | flood |
        | Peret | Oct - Feb | growing |
        | Schemu | Feb - Jun | harvest/drought |
- ** Nile water comes fron summer monsoons in Indian ocean, trapped in mountains of Eritrea and Ethiopia

### **Nile geography
- 4180 miles
- delta
    - Rosetta branch
    - Damietta branch
- Faiyum - oasis with wildlife
- cataracts
    - Aswan at 1st cataract, more cataracts upstream
    - 5th cataract at border with kush
- Tributaries
    - Atbara river, Blue Nile bring fertile silt
        - blue nile branch off at Khartoum, sourced from Lake Tana
    - White Nile privdes majority of the water
        - white nile sourced from Lake Victoria

### Egyptians called themselves
- "Egypt" name from greeks
- "The Two Lands"
    * 1\. Lower Egypt (Delta, Faiyum), wide marshy flat
    * 2\. Upper Egypt, narrow valley, floodplain
        - Aswan steep sandstone cliffs, narrow floodplain
    - double crown/shmty
- Kemet(KMT) "Black Land"/ Deshret (DSRT) "Red Land"
    - eastern and western deserts
        - east is mineral (gold, copper) rich, includes Sinai
        -west is water rich - oases (Faiyum), provide an alternative travel route via desert
    - convention to put 'e' between short consonants
- Orientation
    - East/West, relative to the sun or river banks
    - North/South, the Nile's current

| Upper Egypt | Lower Egypt |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| white crown/hedjet | red crown/deshret|
| lotus | papyrus |
| vulture (Nekhbet) | cobra (Wadjet) |

### Natural Borders
A. Mediterranean Sea
B. Red Sea
C. Nile Delta
D. Faiyum
E. First Cataract/Aswan/Southern Border/Lake Nassar
F. Western Desert
G. Eastern Desert
H. Sinai

### Materials
- **construction**
    - mud for bricks, bakes in sun & used in everyday residential architecture
        - doesn't last, archaeological remains imbalanced towards stone structures
    - red granaite, near Aswan
    - limestone near Giza
    - sandstone everywhere
    - tombs, temples, monumental architecture
    - semiprecious minerals for decorations: turquoise, carnelian, amethyst, cupric oxide (azorite & malacite)
    - flax for linen
    - papyrus: add water, sun, pressure (beat layers together) = paper
        - reeds: build buildings, columns, boats
    - timber, indigenous (short, hard)
        - tamarisk, acacia, sycamore
    - import long timbers
        - cedar from Lebanon, aromatic, soft/carvable, rot-resistant (Khufu's burial barge)
- **grains**
    - emmer wheat -> flour, bread
    - barley -> bread, cades, beer
    - Menkaure's pyramid workers paid in beer 'Drunkards of Menkaure'
    - imported wine, then imported grape vines
    - leumes: lentils, chick peas, fava beans, hummouse foul
    - leafy greens: cucumber, onion, radish, leek
    - oils: flax, sesame, imported olive
- fruits: melon, pomegranate, dates, figs (fiber, sweetener)
- **meats**
    - poultry: lots of birds, water fowl, migratory birds
    - other meat: fish, sheep, goat, pork, oxen, hedgehog
    - donkeys, ibexes from foreigners, camels much later
- **transport**
- reed bundles, wooden plank boats

### Sprituality/elementality in gods
- Ma'at: principle & goddess with ostrich feather headdress
    - order, justice, truth, balance/ opposite of chaos
    - most commonly found in book of the dead/weighing of the heart
- Ra: sun, mounted on hawk or falcon
    - clock-like order in the heavens
- Horus: order on earth as hawk or falcon with crown
    - Pharaoh is embodied Horus
- Osiris: regeneration, killed and reincarnated, ruling the afterlife
    - green/dark skin represents fertile soil & vegetation
    - Pharaoh becomes Osiris in death
    - symbols: feathered white crown, mummy-suit, crook and flail (animal and plant mastery)
- Hapy: god of flooding Nile, nourishment
    - sometimes as twins for Upper & Lower Egypt
    - blue/black/green skin

## Chronology
- influenced by ecology
- 3 main influences for 34-dynasty chronology

#### 1. Manetho's history 'Beloved of Thoth'
- 3rd c. BC priest at Heliopolis/On, near Memphis
- fragments of history referenced by later authors
- dynasties 1-31, starting with Menes, given kingship by Horus
- add Macedonian, Ptolemaic dynasties
- add Dyn 0 for pre-Menes kings

#### 2. Sothic Cycle/Sopdet (Sirius)
- rising tended to coincide with inundation, marking New Year
- misaligned calendar 365 days vs 365.24 days in a year
- New Year and Sothic rising coincided every 1460 years
- recorded observations of risings and coincidences to provide "linchpins" solid dates that connect king-lists to modern calendar
    - Censorinus, 139 CE observation
    - Senusret III's year 7 Dyn 12 1872 BC
    - Meyer found 6 recorded Sothic observations in records in 1904

#### 3. King-lists
- Palermo Stone, Dyn 5
    - earliest king list
    - from pre-dynastic divine kings to Horus to human kings Dynastic 5
    - record notable events and height of the Nile every year of a king's reign
    - Nileometers
- Royal List of Karnak, Thutmose III
    - includes Hyksos kings
- Royal List of Abydos, Seti I
    - pro-Osiris bias
    - no 2nd intermediate period kings
    - no Armana kings
- Royal List of Saqqara, Ramesses II
    - from Anedjib to 
- Royal Canon of Turin
    - over 300 names, including pre-Menes, with moths and days of reign
    - in Hieractic script, not hieroglyphics
    - poorly preserved
    - omits 2nd intermediate period

#### 4. Mostly Accurate w/ Caveats
Margin of Error

| Period & Years | Margin |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Early Dynastic Period (ca.3000-2700) | ~100yrs |
| New Kingdom (ca.1570) | ~decades |
| 664bc | year in babylonian calendar |

### Kingdoms and Dynasties
**Kingdoms** - periods of unity divided by Intermediate Periods
- Two Lands under one king, capitol at/near Memphis
- Three Kingdoms (Old, Middle, New) modern construct:
    - Menes (first of D1), beginning of Early Dynastic period, ca. 3050
    - Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II, beginning of Middle Kingdom, ca. 2050
    - Ahmose, beginning of New Kingdom, ca. 1570

**Dynasties** - kingship passed father to son
- relationship to Queen Mother essential, by blood or marriage (_matrilineality_)
- no claim to throne if not related to Queen Mother

## Cosmology: understanding of the universe
Egyptian universe: bubble or void within watery chaos _Nun_

**Tripartite Cosmos**: heavens, Earth, Duat

**Field of Reeds** in the northern sky with circumpolar stars "the eternal ones"

**Duat**: the netherworld, 12 hours of passage for Re
- Amduat scenes
    - sun/Ra travels through 12 gates watery gates in Duat
    - Apep the serpent threatens passage
    - potentially influenced Christian ideas of Hell

**Akhet** - horizon; dangerous, liminal, transitional place

### Ra
- polymorphic, polynomic
- Ra, sun disc
- Khepri, scarab at dawn
- Atum, ram at sunset
- Ra-Horakthty, merged with Horus
- Aten, life-giving solar disc

## Cosmogeny: understanding of how the world was created
4 creation myths/theologies

#### 1. Hermopolis (earlier)
- originates from city of Thoth (wisdom, writing, magic), who Greeks connect to Hermes
- mentioned in Pyramid Texts
- mound rises out of water
- bird lays an egg on mound
- plurality of gods coming out of chaos
- **Ogdoad**: masculine/feminite counterparts, original gods
    - Nun/Naunet:     water/inertia
    - Huh/Hauhet:     infinity/eternity
    - Kuk/Kauket:     darkness
    - Amun/Amaunet:   uncertainty/hiddenness
    - real world: dry, active, limited, light, tangible

#### 2. Heliopolis
- Plutarch's Isis and Osiris (2nd c.)
- Hymn to Osiris
- Horus & Seth known by Early Dynastic Period, Osiris by Old Kingdom
- Atum is the chief god, created himself and the other gods
- **Ennead**
    - Atum self-evoloving
    - Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture)
    - Nut (sky) and Geb (Earth)
    - Osiris, Set, Isis, Nephthys
    - Horus
- Order (ma'at) vs Chaos (isfet)
- Eye of Horus protection from harm

#### 3. Memphis (later than Heliopolitan)
- cult of Ptah, god of humanistic creativity
- embodies human creation
- turns idea (perception) into reality via annunciation (magic)
    - property of the gods and king
- patron god of craftsmen
- temple Hiku-Ptah represented Egypt to the Greeks
- _Shabaka Stone_ D25, copy of earlier lost papyrus -> turned into millstone
- _Instructions for Merikara_ (FIP-MK ca. 2000bc)
    - made sky and earth, gave breath of life
- _Coffin Text_ 1130bc excerpt, Ra speaking
    - made four winds, great inundation, made every man alike
    - evil comes from men's heart, made them fear the west 
    - created gods from sweat, men from tears
#### 4. Amun cult, centered at Thebes (New Kingdom)

# Stone Age Egypt
1. increasing precision, complexity of stone tools
2. domestication of plants and animals
3. sedentism - permanent houses in villages
challenge: no writing until 3150bc
developments spread acrss many sites
stone tools "type fossils"/diagnostic artifact types

## Paleolithic Egypt
#### Lower Paleolithic c. 400,000-250,000 before present
- Acheulian handaxe, used by _homo erectus_

#### Middle Зaleolithic c. 250,000-50,000 bc
- from cores to flakes
- Levallois flake and core tools
- used by _homo neaderthalensis_
- identified by scatter sites (tools and debitage) & refits
- Taramsa-1 at Dendera: earliest Egyptian middle paleolithic burial, _homo sapiens_

#### Upper Paleolithic c. 50,000-24,000 bc
- long blades, serrated edges
- Nazlet-Khater 4, earliest Egyptian mining site
- _homo sapiens_ skeletal remains

#### Late Paleolithic Egypt c. 24,000-10,000 bc
- microliths/bladelets: backed for mounting, knife, arrow, spear; regular shapes
- Wadi Kubbaniya hunting and fishing around annual lake: red hartebeest, gazelle
- Gebel Sahaba (Sudan) late paleolithic cemetary: simple burials in pits w/o goods projectiles in skeletons (violent deaths)
    - Wild Nile hypothesis: unpredictable Nile floods caused conflicts
- Nataruk, Lake Turkana, Kenya: more violence, is violence/chaos inherently human?
- unprdictable resources, chaos (isfet)

#### Stone Age Achievements
- hunting-gathering-fishing lower paleolithic
- advanced lithics, Levallois brades middle paleolithic
- hman burial Taramsa
- finely made backed blaelets, violence/warfare upper paleolithic
- unpredictable circumstances

## Neolithic: Western Desert, Nile Valley
- domestication of plants and animals
- (fill in)

### Western Desert Neolithic, 8800-4500
#### Nabta Playa
- Earliest Phase 8800-5400
    - has pottery ca. 7000
    - wells, small mud huts, possible permanent settlements
    - wild plants and animals
- Middle PHase 5400-5100
    - domesticated animals, herding over hunting
- Late phase 5100-4700
    - megalithic structure with standing stones
    - cattle under tumulus, potential cult sites
- "calendar circle" 
    - orientation to Sothis disproven with GPS
    - more excavation needed to prove anything
    - example of organized labor

#### Gilf Kebir, SW Egypt, W Desert
- Cave of Swimmers
- show neolithic had wetter conditions

### Nile Valley 5500-4250
#### Faiyum A 5500-4500
- domesticated grain (barley, emmer), earliest in Nile Valley
- storage pits, with sickle blade
- "silo" groups/communal storage
- domesticated sheep, goat, pig
- fishing
- flake tools, improved lunate points, crude polished pottery, baskets
- NO burials or permanent housing (found)

#### Merimde Beni Salama, SW Delta 4750-4250

### Badarian Egypt 4500-4000 BCE
- main site: el-Badari, earliest cultural horizon
- graves and pottery found by Petrie
- begin finding Badarian ceramics in all of Upper Egypt

Contrast to Merimde
- in Upper Egypt, as opposed to Lower Egypt
- no villages found
- extramural burials, cemetaries

#### Badarian
- earliest agriculture in UPper Egypt
- status differentiation in wealth of goods
- groups of elite graves with extramural cemetery
- 'ripple' bowl, type-fossil, possible craft specialists
- pottery generally very fine, burnished ware
- stone cosmetic palettes
- figurines & vases in bone and ivory
- hammered copper & glazed beads (Chalcolithic/copper age)
- 'fully furnished' afterlife
- evidence of class difference: more furnishings for wealthier, segregated graves

# Late Predynastic Egypt
### Naqada I (Amratian) 4000-3500
- social hierarchy

### Naqada II (Gerzan) 3550-3150
- cultural unification
- kingship, vaguely & anonymously

### Naqada III (Dynasty 0) 3150-3050
- political unification
- named kings

### WMF Petrie and Sequence Dating of Naqada Sites, 1899
- predynastic pottery styles or types
- excavated and seriated pottery from 3000 graves at Naqada
- sequence dated pottery types by 1899

- Libby used to check radiocarbon C14 dating in 1940s
- Naqada I types SD 30-39
- Naqada II SD 40-52
- organisms absorb C14 while alive (wood, bone, reeds)

## Naqada I, Amratian 4000-3550
- _hierarchal, militant chiefs_
- red slipped, black-top ware common
    - some white incised decoration
    - warrior, hunting themes
    - similar to Badarian (assemblages more diagnostic than single artifacts)
    - brownish Badarian and Naqada thought to imitate leather
    - all from graves, settlement pattern poorly known
- more complex burials
- ivory figurines with secondary sex characteristics
- fine flint spear points
    - almost too nice for use (probably ceremonial)
- discoid maceheads characteristic of Naqada periods
- faience & stone beads, amulets
- natron trade good for cleaning and embalming

## Naqada II, Gerzean 3500-3150
- diagnostic 'marl-ware' pottery, found throughout Upper & Lower Egypt
    - imagery on pottery match 3D figures
- planked and reed-bundle boats
    - models found in elite graves
    - bronze technology and tools for wood boats
- ripple-flaked blades, apex of Egyptian lithics
- copper tools, more jewelry, precious metal
    - gold, stone necklace, copper harpoon
    - sculpted cosmetic stone palettes
- pear-shaped maceheads
- _classes of craftsmen_
- burials: clay coffin, pets, jars, linen wrapping
- first strong evidence for theology

### Nubt
- 2 'towns' at _Nubt_: rectangular houses and 50x30m structure
- elite graves at Cemetary T, hypogeum for the rich
    - T5 nearly a full underground house for a chief
- New Kingdom temple for Seth, possibly patron god of Nubt

### Hierakonpolis _Nekhen_
- tomb 100, also underground house with brick walls
- earliest tomb painting on wall: hunting and battle scenes, wooden plank boats
- center of Horus cult
- post holes with valuable cedar

## Naqada III, Dynasty 0 3150-3050
political unification of Egypt
- historians Manetho, Herodotus say Menes, but name doesn't exist from contemporary evience
- **Palermo Stone**, predynastic divine kings, maybe Naqada kings, missing 1st human king
- *Abydos* - Osiris cult center
    - Tomb U-j at Umm el-Qa'ab: hundreds of imported Canaanite wine jars, earliest hieroglyphs on royal tags, trade, record-keeping (bureaucracy), _Scorpion_
    - serakh: royal falcon sitting on building, symbolize king/palace
    - Narmer label, name in serekh with Horus, shows victory over marsh-dwellers
        - some doubts from lack of destruction evidence in Delta (Sagan's Law evidence of absence is not absence of evidence), archaeological evidence hasn't survived
    - seal impression listing Narmer as last king of D0 before Aha of D1
- *Hierakonpolis* "_main deposit_" 
- Scorpion
    - Scorpion macehead, king in white crown with hoe and conquered, possible also red crown
    - Battlefield Pelette, Tehenu/Siege/Lybian Palette, commemorating victories by king or kings (lion, falcon, scorpion) over walled towns
- Narmer
    - Narmer Palette: complete, has unification, conquering king wash, both crowns, mace/scepter, sandal bearer, Horus conquering delta, serekh with name, Hathor (house of Horus), control of chaos (no double crown?)
    - Narmer macehead
    - not necessarily Menes
- Aha/Hor-Aha/Men
    - on ivory tag, given first title of "Two Ladies"
    - nebti-name "Men" (Menes?)
    - moved capital to Memphis, given credit for unification
        - established a capital and the notion of a unified nation
- Contrasting stories of unification
    - historians Herodotus, Manetho describe legendary figure Menes
    - archaeology shows evidence of gradual unification involving multiple leaders and violence

## Development of Settlement and Kingship
- agrarian life ca. 5000
    - pool resources (e.g. food)
    - more security (strength in numbers), but increase in spread of disease
    - _infant mortality_: children make it past neonatal period
- social stratification ca. 4000
    - land management: rule people to make land valuable
- Upper Egypt first
    - Heliopolitan myth recognizes inherent conflict, estaplishes dynastic principle (oldest son rules), identifiying ruler with fierce predator balances order vs chaos, rather than annihilation
    - transportation, law
    - land management/territoriality not an issue in the delta
    - controlling people in linear valley is easier

# Early Dynastic Period: D1-2
- sources: king lists, Manetho via Josephus et al, inscribed artifacts
- Abydos provides most documentation for D0-2, royal cemetary, border between fertile land and desert

## Dynasty 1 3050-2890
- don't know exact reigns, but know order: Hor-Aha(Mene), Djer, Djet, Merneith\*, Den, Anedjib/Adjib, Smerkhet, Qa'a
- tombs have funerary structures, most have satellite burials
- some tombs reused as Middle Kingdom cenotaphs
- found before 1900, all looted, burned, reused
- Aha's wife Neith-hotep "Neith is satisfied" ruled during Djer's reign, earlier female de facto ruler, goddess of hunting, weaving
- Merneith (queen) "Beloved of Neith"
    - Merneith's tomb (Tomb Y) combined mound inside wall, within satellite burials
        - Merneith has 2nd empty Saqqara tomb (Cenotaph - symbolic empty tomb), architectural shape _mastaba_ Arabic "bench"
        - central burial chamber and store magazines
        - "mother of king" title from seal: vulture, sedge-plant
- satellite burials: young skeletons, neatly aligned, probably strangled -> human sacrifice?
    - New Kingdom ushabti figurne with spell to activate service in aferlife - more human means of eternal service
- 14 cedar boat fleet, each encased in brick and plaster, buried next to a funerary enclosure, oldest boats found
    - 3 possible functions: solar barges, funerary procession, everyday boats to be used in the afterlife
- Saqqara cenotaph 3038 with Adjib/Anedjib sealings
    - 1st stepped architecture enclosure and tomb/cenotaph combined + stepped mound on seal
- Saqqara elite official 3057 facade is more organic
    - ~imitate wood, reeds, or woven architecture, some paint preserved
    - clay modeled bull heads
- _imitative magic_: architecture simulating organic elements important to tomb owner's afterlife
- some real items: resin, wine, incense
- more writing used in late D1

### Saqqara nomarchs vs monarchs
- 20-21 nomes
- Tomb 3505 mastaba has stele of Merkha, titles include nomarch, captain of royal trip, controller of palace
- Kathryn Bard: 
    - D1 pharaohs buried at Abydos, pharaoh cenotaphs + officials at Saqqara
    - D2-3 pharaohs mostly at Saqqara, except Peribsen & Khasekhem; Abydos abandoned until MK Osiris cult

## Dynasty 2 2890-2686
- 7 kings
- Peribsen switched from Horus to Seth title over serekh
- Khasekhem(wy - dual marker) has Horus, then also Seth on serekh
- cult shift or political disunity? both pharaohs buried at Abydos instead of Saqqara
    - divine kingship worked for organizing labor
- many Khasekhemwy statues from main deposit - earliest ka-statue for receiving offerings?
    - largest tomb in Abydos, could fit all of D1 offerings
    - name appears with cobra & vulture/two ladies on fragments
    - central tomb limestone - 1st large stone construction
    - copper tools(model&life) & vessels, stone vessels, gold covers, flint tools, pottery wit hgrain and fruit, glazed objects, carnelian beans, ceramic jars, basketry
    - mound within enclosure - pyramid precursor
- officials' tombs in Abydos resemble mastaba private tombs in later Old Kingdom, buried in cedar coffins and beginnings of mummification

## Early Dynastic
- unification in D0, consolidation in D1-2, inflation Old Kingdom
- capital est in Memphis
- bureaucracy
- writing developed

#### 1. State Control
- seals & tags, serekh-names on pots
- suggest ownership and accounting system, probably taxation

#### 2. Government/palace built at Memphis, near conquered Delta
- nothing excavated yet
- _consolidation_

#### 3. Conscribed Labor for large construction projects off-season
- employment/exploitation, but not slavery
- temporary human sacrifice
- imitative magic used architecturally

#### 4. King _consumed_ enormous natural and human resources
- human sacrifice in D1 - extreme conspicuous consumption
- buried cedar boats

#### 5. Divine kingship (Horus or Seth)
- legitimized control over land, resources, labor
- unification lasted 800 yrs
- people and elites are buying into ideology of divine kingship

## Continuity into Old Kingdom
- key architectural and cultural traits (funerary enclosures, mounds, stepped arch, pyramid, boat burials, mastaba tombs) derived from early dynastic prototypes

# Writing System: Ancient Egyptian Language
- _hieroglyph_ Greek: "sacred carving"; Egyptian: "divine words"
- language is communication system for using sounds or symbols, governed by rules (grammar) and changes over time/space (dialects)
- writing is letters or symbols impressed on a surface to represent the sounds or words of a language; imperfect representation & not necessarily intended to represent spoken language
- Egyptian writing left out vowels & vocalizations
- Afro-Asiatic language family - related to North African & Semitic language
- last used 4th c. CE
- spoken language developed into Coptic, early Christian era, later replaced by Arabic by 11th c., rare uses gone by 17th c.

## Deciphering Hieroglyphs
- 4th-5th c. CE Hor-Apollo's _Hieroglyphica_
    - incorrectly assumes symbology
- 9th-10th c. CE Arab historians Dhul-nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya
    - suspect phonetic elements
    - Coptic manuscripts held important clues
- 11th c. Arabic replaces Egyptian
- 16th-18th c.
    - European scholars attempt deciphering by symbology
    - Pietro delle Valle collected Coptic manuscripts
- 17th c. Athanasius Kircher
    - Coptic related to earlier Egyptian scripts, containing phonetic elemets
    - lacked proof
- 1799 Napoleon's soldiers find Rosetta Stone in Nile Delta
    - Jean-Francois Champollion (and Thomas Young) demonstrated phonetic nature of script
    - Champollion Chair of Egyptology 1836
- 20th c. AH Gardiner, A Erman, RO Faulkner, Polotsky, Hoch, JP Allen

## Egyptian Grammar
- VSO word order
- 2 grammatical genders: M/F
- 3 gramatical numbers: singular, dual/pair, plural
- triconsonantal roots like Semitic languages
    - CCC prefixes/suffixes/infixes to create NVA from same CCC root

## Development of Script
- appears in archaeological record by 3100 BC
- appears somewhat developed
    - suggests sudden invention rather than gradual evolution
    - relatively few changes

## 6 Stages of Writing System
1. Archaic Egyptian (before 2600 BC) : D0-D2
2. Old Egyptian (2600-2100 BC): Old Kingdom
3. Middle Egyptian (2100-1600BC): Middle Kingdom
- most complete form
- later changes are simplifications and borrowings
4. Late Egyptian (1600-600 BC): New Kingdom to Early Greek
- more foreign words
5. Demotic (650 BC-4th c. CE): 3rd Intermediate to Late Period
- Persian, Macedonian, Ptolemaic, Roman
6. Coptic (1st-11th c. CE):

### Scripts
Hieroglyphs
- earliest
- cut into stone incised or sculpted relief
- carved with hammer and chisel
- top to bottom, but left-right or right-left, depending on visual context (not textual)

Cursive Hieroglyphs
- Old Kingdom
- exclusively funerary texts (coffin texts, pyramid texts, book of the dead)
- red ink indicates beginning of new section or spell
- written with brush
- top to bottom, but left-right or right-left, depending on visual context (not textual)

Hieratic
- Old Kingdom
- administrative & various uses
- developed for everyday stylus writing on papyrus
- more cursive red and black ink
- written right to left (notable shift)
- harder to see correlation with hieroglyphs

Demotic
- Late Period
- painted
- little to no resemblance to hieroglyphs
- carved on Rosetta Stone

### Reading & Arrangement
- read into faces of animate signs/ approach from "front"
- no punctuation
- right to left or left to right, usually top to bottom
- compact, space-efficient
- about 500 signs used on regular basis

## Types of Signs
1. Phonograms
- phonetic signs
- individual sounds assembled into words
- uni- bi- tri- consonantal signs
2. Logograms/Ideograms
- sign is entire word or concept
- some are used as syllables (rebus principle)
3. Determinatives
- not pronounced
- 'helpers' for meaning, as disambiguators
- e.g. Pharaoh written as two logograms "house"(per) + "great"(ah)
    - vertical strike under house = determinative to indicate phonetic sign instead of logogram

![Pharaoh hieroglyphs](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/pharaoh.png)

- e.g. "per" = "to walk"
    - house(biconsonant)"per" + mouth (uniconsonant) "r" + walking (determinative) "pri"

![Pharaoh hieroglyphs](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/walk.png)

- other common logograms in royal inscriptions: 
- ankh follows pharaoh's name
- son of Ra "sa Ra"/daughter of Ra "saat Ra"

![Daughter of Ra hieroglyphs](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/daughter-of-ra.png)

- lord of the two lands  "neb tawy" dual ending, written with reduplicated logogram
