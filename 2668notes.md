## 24-26/1
**sedentism** - emergence of farming, village life

monarchy/kingship
- power acquisition and maintenance
- legitimacy

empire - Why do states expand and how is it legitimized?
collapse: failure of divine kingship

What is civilization?
- art, architecture, religion, writing
- power
- magic act, images,texts, rituals


## 26/1 Controlling the Past/Archaeology, History, Colonialism, and Magic Meet in Egypt
Auguste Mariette (Fr)
- 1850
- Louvre purchaser
- founds Antiquities Service, Cairo Museum

Heinrich Schliemann (Gr)
- 1870
- discovered Troy and stratigraphy - excavation by layers to keep sense of time

William Flinders Petrie (Eng)
- 1880
- pyramidologist (sent to measure Great Pyramid)
- pioneered Egyptian stratigraphic archaeology

colonial powers try to amass collections
- image of being the civilization that pro
- motivations:
	* political and military influences
	* profit
	* historical artifact
	* cofirmation of Bible/other texts

# Discovery & Development of Egyptology
## 29+31/1 Steps to Egyptology/ Exploring, Collecting
### Archaeology
- less colonial now - cooperative/joint projects
- local population has more say
- more professional: scientific methods, inquisitive, rather than acquisitive
	* publish findings
	* peer-reviewed journals
- sites are protected
- record position of everything bc archaeology is destruction
- excavations with stratigraphic controls
	* layers of occupation (strata) carefully exposed
	* 100 yrs thick or 1 season in a year

### 3 Steps to Archaeology in ANE and Egypt
1\. Exploration, including travel (5th-17th century)
- 5th c BC Herodotous, Greek historian of Persian Wars
- 3rd c CE Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, Onomasticon, list of place-names
- 4th c CE Queen Helena's pilgrimmage, Imp. Contantine's mother
- 7th c. Arab explorers going beyond Ptolemy's geography, Strabo
- 9th c. Caliph al-Ma'mun penetrates the pyramids for treasure rather than knowledge
	* vinegar and battering ram - hole still used for tourists
- 12th c. CE Al-idrisi produce maps based on works of the ancient Greeks
- 13th c. CE Yaqut al-Hamavi writes Mujam al-Buldan
	* worked his way out of slavery as merchant's assistant & became scholar
	* foundational work in encyclopedic geography
    * copied into 6 vol. German in 17th c, stimulating travel later
- 1480, 1483 German friar Felix Fabri /Wanderings/ to Palestine and Egypt
	* non-scientific travel log, with personal notes on places and people
- 1400-1700 at least 200 accounts of pilgrimmages to Egypt and Palestine
- 1505 during renaissance Hor-Apollo's Hieroglyphica published (coneceived during 5th c)
	* mistakenly believed that hieroglyphs were magic symbols for natural and moral principles "symbology"
	* held back actual deciphering

2\. Collecting (17th-19th century)
- Private: _antiquarianism_ or amateur archaeology
	* 17th c. Pietro della Valle, collecting Coptic (ancient Egyptian language written in Greek script) manuscripts in Egypt
	* 1646 John Greaves /Pyramidographica/ Mis-measured Khufu pyramid as 152m high
	* 1800 "pyramid inch" theory of Joyn Taylor: sides of great pyramid = 36,524 'pyramid inches' - days in a solar year
	* *disproved by Petrie in 1880
    * 1751 Frederik Norden's illustrated travelogues, bestseller, inaccurate
- public: nationalistic, museum collecting
    * France & GB competing to the Indian Ocean fastest 18th-19th century
    * 1798 Napoleon wants to open Suez Canal/Port Said for strategic advantages & invades Egypt
        - found Rosetta Stone, decree of Ptolemy V: hieroglyphic, demotic, greek
        - Thomas Young guessed cartouche (cartridge) represented monarch's name
        - savants illustrated landmarks in Description de l'Egypte (1809-30)
    * 1799-1808 Admiral Nelson evicts French & British Museum gets Rosetta Stone
    * 1822-36 Jean-Francois Champollion deciphers hieroglyphs via rubbing (copy)
        - phonetic and logographic principles, debunk symbology & produce grammar
        - 1936 College du France 1st chairman of first egyptology department
    * Europeans 'going native'/orientalism
    * 1815-22 Giovanni Belzoni 'Patagonian Samson', Italian ex-pat turned circus performer collecting for the British
        discovered Seti I's tomb
    * 1850s Auguste Mariette, Frenchman collecting for Louvre, founds Egyptian Antiquities Service and Cairo Museum

3\. Archaeology/Egyptology (scientific, 19th century to present)
- 1833,63 Charles Lyell, /Principles of Geology/ and /Geological evidences of the antiquity of man?
    - gradual evolutionary change rather than catastrophic Biblical change
    - geological layers, gradual change, law of superposition (top layers are later than lower layers)

# Chronology and Cosmology
## 2/2 Cultural Ecology
- Egypt is a gift of the Nile - small area of fertile land around Nile within a desert
- length 4180 mi, Egypt is lower 750mi (1st cataract to delta)
- 1-11 mi wide, usually 1 mi; flow 1-4 knots downstream; travel ~ 2 weeks or months
- schedule and seasons
    -   | Name | Months | Activity |
        | ---- | ------ | -------- |
        | Akhet | Jun - Oct | flood |
        | Peret | Oct - Feb | growing |
        | Schemu | Feb - Jun | harvest/drought |
- **Nile water comes fron summer monsoons in Indian ocean, trapped in mountains of Eritrea and Ethiopia

### **Nile geography
- 4180 miles
- delta
    - Rosetta branch
    - Damietta branch
- Faiyum - oasis with wildlife
- cataracts
    - Aswan at 1st cataract, more cataracts upstream
    - 5th cataract at border with kush
- Tributaries
    - Atbara river, Blue Nile bring fertile silt
        - blue nile branch off at Khartoum, sourced from Lake Tana
    - White Nile privdes majority of the water
        - white nile sourced from Lake Victoria

### Egyptians called themselves
- "Egypt" name from greeks
- "The Two Lands"
    * 1\. Lower Egypt (Delta, Faiyum), wide marshy flat
    * 2\. Upper Egypt, narrow valley, floodplain
        - Aswan steep sandstone cliffs, narrow floodplain
    - double crown/shmty
- Kemet(KMT) "Black Land"/ Deshret (DSRT) "Red Land"
    - eastern and western deserts
        - east is mineral (gold, copper) rich, includes Sinai
        -west is water rich - oases (Faiyum), provide an alternative travel route via desert
    - convention to put 'e' between short consonants
- Orientation
    - East/West, relative to the sun or river banks
    - North/South, the Nile's current

| Upper Egypt | Lower Egypt |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| white crown/hedjet | red crown/deshret|
| lotus | papyrus |
| vulture (Nekhbet) | cobra (Wadjet) |

### Natural Borders
A. Mediterranean Sea
B. Red Sea
C. Nile Delta
D. Faiyum
E. First Cataract/Aswan/Southern Border/Lake Nassar
F. Western Desert
G. Eastern Desert
H. Sinai

### Materials
- **construction**
    - mud for bricks, bakes in sun & used in everyday residential architecture
        - doesn't last, archaeological remains imbalanced towards stone structures
    - red granaite, near Aswan
    - limestone near Giza
    - sandstone everywhere
    - tombs, temples, monumental architecture
    - semiprecious minerals for decorations: turquoise, carnelian, amethyst, cupric oxide (azorite & malacite)
    - flax for linen
    - papyrus: add water, sun, pressure (beat layers together) = paper
        - reeds: build buildings, columns, boats
    - timber, indigenous (short, hard)
        - tamarisk, acacia, sycamore
    - import long timbers
        - cedar from Lebanon, aromatic, soft/carvable, rot-resistant (Khufu's burial barge)
- **grains**
    - emmer wheat -> flour, bread
    - barley -> bread, cades, beer
    - Menkaure's pyramid workers paid in beer 'Drunkards of Menkaure'
    - imported wine, then imported grape vines
    - leumes: lentils, chick peas, fava beans, hummouse foul
    - leafy greens: cucumber, onion, radish, leek
    - oils: flax, sesame, imported olive
- fruits: melon, pomegranate, dates, figs (fiber, sweetener)
- **meats**
    - poultry: lots of birds, water fowl, migratory birds
    - other meat: fish, sheep, goat, pork, oxen, hedgehog
    - donkeys, ibexes from foreigners, camels much later
- **transport**
- reed bundles, wooden plank boats

### Sprituality/elementality in gods
- Ma'at: principle & goddess with ostrich feather headdress
    - order, justice, truth, balance/ opposite of chaos
    - most commonly found in book of the dead/weighing of the heart
- Ra: sun, mounted on hawk or falcon
    - clock-like order in the heavens
- Horus: order on earth as hawk or falcon with crown
    - Pharaoh is embodied Horus
- Osiris: regeneration, killed and reincarnated, ruling the afterlife
    - green/dark skin represents fertile soil & vegetation
    - Pharaoh becomes Osiris in death
    - symbols: feathered white crown, mummy-suit, crook and flail (animal and plant mastery)
- Hapy: god of flooding Nile, nourishment
    - sometimes as twins for Upper & Lower Egypt
    - blue/black/green skin

## Chronology
- influenced by ecology
- 3 main influences for 34-dynasty chronology
1. Manetho's history 'Beloved of Thoth'
    - 3rd c. BC priest at Heliopolis/On, near Memphis
    - fragments of history referenced by later authors
    - dynasties 1-31, starting with Menes, given kingship by Horus
    - add Macedonian, Ptolemaic dynasties
    - add Dyn 0 for pre-Menes kings
2. Sothic Cycle
    Sopdet (Sirius)
    - rising tended to coincide with inundation, marking New Year
    - misaligned calendar 365 days vs 365.24 days in a year
    - New Year and Sothic rising coincided every 1460 years
    - recorded observations of risings and coincidences to provide "linchpins" solid dates that connect king-lists to modern calendar
        - Censorinus, 139 CE observation
        - Senusret III's year 7 Dyn 12 1872 BC
        - Meyer found 6 recorded Sothic observations in records in 1904
3. King-lists
    a. Palermo Stone, Dyn 5
        - earliest king list
        - from pre-dynastic divine kings to Horus to human kings Dynastic 5
        - record notable events and height of the Nile every year of a king's reign
        - Nileometers
    b. Royal List of Karnak, Thutmose III
    c. Royal List of Abydos, Seti I
    d. Royal List of Saqqara, Ramesses II
    e. 


Ogdoad: masculine/feminite counterparts, original gods
Nun/Naunet:     water/inertia
Huh/Hauhet:     infinity
Kuk/Kauket:     darkness
Amun/Amaunet:   uncertainty/hiddenness
real world: dry, active, limited, light, tangible

Ennead
Atum self-evoloving
Shu and Tefnut
Nut and Geb
Osiris, Set, Isis, Nephthys

Ptah of Memphis
- embodies human creation
- turns idea (perception) into reality via annunciation
    - property of the gods and king
