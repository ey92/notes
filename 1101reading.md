# Chapter 1: Introduction
## 3 Types of Grammar:
1) _mental grammar_
	- set of elements and rules of language system
	- rules that cannot be incorrect, despite differences from other speakers
2) _descriptive grammar_
	- objective description of a speaker's or group of speakers' knowledge of a language (competence) based on their use of the language (performance)
	- provides better picture of speaker's language competence
	e.g. some sentences end with preposition, some infinitives are split, some use double negatives
3) _prescriptive grammar_
	- a set of rules designed to give instructions regarding the socially embedded notion of the "correct" or "proper" way to speak or write
		e.g. don't end with preposition, don't split infinitives, don't use double negatives

## Knowing a Language:
1) recognizing sounds that are part of the language
2) breaking down words into parts with meaning or function
3) morphology
4) syntax - combine & form phrases
5) semantics - understanding & forming meaning

## Linguistic Competence:
1) lexicon
2) rules/mental grammar
	- _grammar_: language system, set of elements and rules (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics)
	- _rule_: statement of pattern that occurs in language, including how to combine sounds form 
	utterances

## Non-essential Aspects of Language:
1) _writing_
	- writing is less basic than speech:
		- writing must be taught
		- not all languages are written
		- neurolinguistic evidence - writing activates same parts of brain as speech + more
		- writing can be edited before sharing/ speech is spontaneous
		- archaeological evidence that writing came later than spoken language
	- why writing might be considered more 'perfect' than speech
		- can be edited - more organized, fewer errors, pauses
		- must be taught and associated with education
		- more physically stable
2) _prescriptive grammar_
	mark social identity & used for sical mobility
	easier for nonstandard dialect speakers to explicitly learn standard dialect

## Design Features of Language (Hockett)
- a set of 9 descriptive characteristics of language necessary for a communication system to be considered a language
- all systems have first 3, only human have last 2
1. _mode of communication_
	- e.g. voice, gestures
2. _semanticity_
	- property of having signals that convey a meaning, shared by all communiation systems
	- hear a word you don't know, assume it has meaning
3. _pragmatic function_
	- systems must serve useful purpose - help survival, influence others' behavior, exploring the world
4. _interchangeability_
	- ability of individuals to both transmit and receive messages
5. _cultural transmission_
	- aspects of language that can only be acquired via communicative interaction with other users
6. _arbitrariness_
	- refers to the fact that a word's meaning is not predictable from its linguistic form nor its meaning
	- nonarbitrariness: form represents meaning directly (iconic/picture-like)
		- evidence: cross-linguistic comparisons
		- onomatopoeia - a nonarbitrary aspect of language where the words imitate natural sounds or meaning is associated with nature
		- sound symbolism - phenomenon where certain sounds are evocative of a particular meaning
			e.g. 'small' have 'i' sound (teeny, wee, mikros); 
				use high-pitched vowel because small objects give off high pitched sounds
		- speakers well-aware of nonarbitrary aspects and often used in poetry for example
7. _discreteness_
	- property of language that allows discrete units to be combined into larger communicative units
	- every language has limited number of sounds, but the ability to combine them in so many ways to express many ideas makes them useful
8. _displacement_
	- the ability of a language to communicate about things, actions, and ideas that aren't present in space or time while speakers are communicating (or just things that don't exist)
9. _productivity_
	- capacity of communication system for novel messages built out of discrete units to be produced and understood
	- differs from discreteness in that the units can be recombined into new messages and still be understood
	- understood because there are rules for how to put the sounds/morphemes/words together
	- rules at all levels of linguistic structure are productive & grant the ability to communicate about broad range of ideas

languages have all 9 parts, but does having them mke a communication system a language?
- formal languages aren't natural languages
- constructed languages have te potential to become natural languages if learned by native speakers and adopted by speech community (e.g. modern hebrew)
- must be learnable

## Language Modality
- _auditory-vocal/aural-oral/spoken languages_
	- misconception that language is inseparable from speech comes from interchanging terms speech and language
- _visual-gestural/signed languages_
	- usually used by those with hearing difficulties
	- an be acquired as a first language
	- other than modality, similar to spoken languages in every other way
	- misconceptions:
		- 1\. _signed language_ vs. _manual codes_: signed languages are NOT derived from spoken languages and evolve naturally and independently of spoken languages
			- British Sign Language & American Sign Language are unrelated
			- manual codes for spoken languages exist
			- true languages are more efficient than signed codes
		- 2\. _signed language_ vs. _pantomime_: false impression that signers draw pictures in air or act out the meaning
			- 2 misconceptions:
			- a\. signed languages don't have internal structure but governed by the same sorts of phonological, morphological, syntactic rules that govern spoken languages
			- b\. signed language words are completely iconic; if true, no need to learn
			- association signs to meanings are still arbitrary (even if iconic when introduced, evolved to become more arbitrary)
			- pantomime idea would restrict signed language from being able to communicate about abstract concepts
		- 3\. _universality of signed languages_ - there is NOT only one signed language
			- may come from the idea of the pantomime myth, where iconicity would lend itself to universality
	- when large enough proportion of a population is deaf, the rest are fluent in signing
	- hard to represent in 2D
- studying different modalities allow linguists to observe things such as minimum pause length in spoken language but no minimum pause in signed language


# Chapter 2: Phonetics
phonetics: consonants, vowels, melodies, rhythms
- figuring out which sounds are possible is critical

### 3 aspects:
1\. _articulary phonetics_ - study of production of speech sounds
- which sounds are possible?
- which parts of the mouth are used?
- use x-rays, EM articulograph receptors, ultrasound
- palatography to observe tongue/roof of mouth contact, airflow, air pressure

2\. _acoustic phonetics_ - study of transmission and physical properties of speech sounds
- concerns characteristics of sounds produced by articulations
- use sound spectrograph

3\. _auditory phonetics_ - study of perception of speech sounds
- how humans perceive pronunciation
- observe human responses to stimuli
- use MRI and CT
- impressionistic phonetic transcription
	- spelling is conventionalized to symbolize shared meaning, not pronunciation
	- avoid ambiguity:
		- each symbol should only represent on sound/phone & vice versa <c>
		- if two sounds can distinguish one word from another <th>
		- if two sounds very similar and difference comes from context, similarity should be represented <k> (_coarticulation_)
	- English is bad:
		- same sound is spelled using different letters
		- sometimes same letter has different sounds
		- sometimes single sound is spelled by combination of letters
		- sometimes single letter represents combination of sounds
		- sometimes letters don't represent any sound e.g. know, doubt, island
	- must be consistent and unambiguous 1-to-1 correspondence between sounds and symbols

### Types of Speech Sounds
1. segments
2. suprasegmentals

consonants vs. vowels
| - | consonants | vowels |
| - | ---------- | ------ |
| articulary  | produce constriction in vocal tract to impede airflow | slight narrowing & allow air to flow freely
| acoustically | usually less intense | usually more intense |
| auditory | - | prominent nucleus of each syllable |

- a _syllable_ can contains 1+ sounds & can be broken down into an _onset_ and a _rhyme_
- all syllables have a rhyme, but onset is optional in some languages
- _rhyme_ can be broken down into _nucleus_ and _coda_
- _vowels_ can be divided into 2 categories: _monophthongs_ and _diphthongs_

- _running speech_/_continuous speech_: we speak on a daily basis with words, phrases, sentences, run together
- pronunciation of words may be affected by surrounding words

# Vocab
## Ch. 1 Introduction
**linguist** - someone who studies the structure of language and its use

**language** - an abstract cognitive system that uniquely allows humans to produce and comprehend meaningful utterances

**linguistic competence** - the unconscious knowledge a speaker has about his or her native language

**linguistic performance** - the observable use of language/actualization of one's linguistic knowledge

**performance error** - errors in language production or comprehension, including hesitations and slips of the tongue

**communication chain**: source, transmitter, signal, receiver, destination

**noise** - interference in the communication chain

**phonetics** - study of minimal units of language (sounds)

**phonology** - language-specific knowledge about the distribution of speech sounds
	allows you to recognize sounds and words spoken by different speakers

**morphology** - the study of how words are constructed out of morphemes

**syntax** - component of mental grammar that deals with constructing phrasal expressions out of smaller expressions; subfield of linguistics that studies how expressions can combine to form larger expressions

**'grammatical'** - correct grammar, according to descriptive grammar, esp syntax

**'ungrammatical'** - not following descriptive grammartical rules, esp syntax

**semantics** - study of linguistic meaning

**pragmatics** - study of how context affects language use, whether or not it is by chance in a context and how the context affects the utterance's meaning or interpretation

**lexicon** - mental repository of linguistic information about words and other lexical expressions, including their form and meaning and their morphological and syntactic properties;part of mental lexicon, including entries that capture relevant properties of lexical expressions

**language acquisition** - process by which children acquire lexicon and grammatical rules of language

**language variation** - property of languages having different ways to express the same meanings in different contexts, according to factors such as geography, social class, gender, social class, etc.

**writing** - physical representation of language other than speech; adds an extra step to communcation process

**form** - the structure or shape of any particular linguistic item, from individual segments to strings of words

**linguistic sign** - combination of form and meaning; connection between form and meaning is typically arbitrary

**formal language** - communication system that has both semantic and syntactic rules and that encodes ideas with symbols that represent particular meanings, but could never be the native language of a human

**natural language** - a language that has evolved naturally in a speech community

**constructed language** - a language that has been designed by an individual or group of individuals for some particular purpose, such as use in a fictional world or international communication, but did not originate as the native language of any speech community

**modality** - mode of communication; tells us how the language is produced and how it is perceived
- **auditory-vocal**/**aural-vocal**/**spoken languages** - perceived via hearing & produced via speech
- **visual-gestural**/**signed languages** - perceived visually and produced via hand and arm movements, facial expressions, and head movements

**code** - an artificially constructed system for representing a natural language; borrows its structure from the natural language it represents; doesn't have native speakers e.g. Morse code

## Ch. 2 Phonetics
**phonetics** - study of minimal units that make up language

**articulary phonetics** - study of production of speech sounds

**acoustic phonetics** - study of transmission and physical properties of speech sounds

**auditory phonetics** - study of perception of speech sounds

**palatography** - experimental method that shows the contact between the tongue and the roof of the mouth

**sound spectrograph** - equipment that generates spectrograms from speech input

**spectrogram** - a 3D representation of sound: time x frequency x amplitude

**impressionistic phonetic transcription** - a method of writing down speech sounds with the intent of capturing how they are pronounced; usually based simply on how the sounds are perceived when heard without any special analysis

**coarticulation** - the adjustment of articulation of a segment due to the influence of a neighboring sound(s)

**segments** - discrete units of speech stream and can be further divided into consonants, transcribed with discrete symbols

**segmental feature** - a phonetic characteristic of speech sounds, such as voicing, place of articulation, rounding, etc.

**suprasegmental feature** - a phonetic characteristic of speech sounds, such as lenght, intonation, tone, or stress that "rides on top of" segmental features; usually identified by comparison to same feature on other sounds or strings of sounds

**consonant** - speech sound produced with constriction somewhere in the vocal tract that impedes airflow

**vowel** - speech sound produced with at most only a slight narrowing somewhere in the vocal tract, allowing air to flow freely through the oral cavity

**monophthong** - a simple vowel, composed of a single configuration of vocal organs

**diphthong** - a complex vowel, composed of a sequence of two different configurations of the vocal organs

**syllable** - a unit of speech, made up of an onset and rhyme

**onset** - any consonant that occurs before the rhyme

**rhyme** - in a syllable, the vowel and any consonants that follow it

**nucleus** - vocalic part of rhyme; core element of a syllable, carrying stress, length, and pitch/tone; usually vowel or syllabic consonant (m,n,l,r)

**coda** - in a syllable, any consonant(s) that occur in the rhyme, after the nucleus

**running speech/continuous speech** - the usual form of spoken language, with all the words and phrases run together, without pauses in between them
