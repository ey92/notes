# Chapter 1: Introduction
## 3 Types of Grammar:
1) _mental grammar_
	- set of elements and rules of language system
	- rules that cannot be incorrect, despite differences from other speakers
2) _descriptive grammar_
	- objective description of a speaker's or group of speakers' knowledge of a language (competence) based on their use of the language (performance)
	- provides better picture of speaker's language competence
	e.g. some sentences end with preposition, some infinitives are split, some use double negatives
3) _prescriptive grammar_
	- a set of rules designed to give instructions regarding the socially embedded notion of the "correct" or "proper" way to speak or write
		e.g. don't end with preposition, don't split infinitives, don't use double negatives

## Knowing a Language:
1) recognizing sounds that are part of the language
2) breaking down words into parts with meaning or function
3) morphology
4) syntax - combine & form phrases
5) semantics - understanding & forming meaning

## Linguistic Competence:
1) lexicon
2) rules/mental grammar
	- _grammar_: language system, set of elements and rules (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics)
	- _rule_: statement of pattern that occurs in language, including how to combine sounds form 
	utterances

## Non-essential Aspects of Language:
1) _writing_
	- writing is less basic than speech:
		- writing must be taught
		- not all languages are written
		- neurolinguistic evidence - writing activates same parts of brain as speech + more
		- writing can be edited before sharing/ speech is spontaneous
		- archaeological evidence that writing came later than spoken language
	- why writing might be considered more 'perfect' than speech
		- can be edited - more organized, fewer errors, pauses
		- must be taught and associated with education
		- more physically stable
2) _prescriptive grammar_
	mark social identity & used for sical mobility
	easier for nonstandard dialect speakers to explicitly learn standard dialect

## Design Features of Language (Hockett)
- a set of 9 descriptive characteristics of language necessary for a communication system to be considered a language
- all systems have first 3, only human have last 2
1. _mode of communication_
	- e.g. voice, gestures
2. _semanticity_
	- property of having signals that convey a meaning, shared by all communiation systems
	- hear a word you don't know, assume it has meaning
3. _pragmatic function_
	- systems must serve useful purpose - help survival, influence others' behavior, exploring the world
4. _interchangeability_
	- ability of individuals to both transmit and receive messages
5. _cultural transmission_
	- aspects of language that can only be acquired via communicative interaction with other users
6. _arbitrariness_
	- refers to the fact that a word's meaning is not predictable from its linguistic form nor its meaning
	- nonarbitrariness: form represents meaning directly (iconic/picture-like)
		- evidence: cross-linguistic comparisons
		- onomatopoeia - a nonarbitrary aspect of language where the words imitate natural sounds or meaning is associated with nature
		- sound symbolism - phenomenon where certain sounds are evocative of a particular meaning
			e.g. 'small' have 'i' sound (teeny, wee, mikros); 
				use high-pitched vowel because small objects give off high pitched sounds
		- speakers well-aware of nonarbitrary aspects and often used in poetry for example
7. _discreteness_
	- property of language that allows discrete units to be combined into larger communicative units
	- every language has limited number of sounds, but the ability to combine them in so many ways to express many ideas makes them useful
8. _displacement_
	- the ability of a language to communicate about things, actions, and ideas that aren't present in space or time while speakers are communicating (or just things that don't exist)
9. _productivity_
	- capacity of communication system for novel messages built out of discrete units to be produced and understood
	- differs from discreteness in that the units can be recombined into new messages and still be understood
	- understood because there are rules for how to put the sounds/morphemes/words together
	- rules at all levels of linguistic structure are productive & grant the ability to communicate about broad range of ideas

languages have all 9 parts, but does having them mke a communication system a language?
- formal languages aren't natural languages
- constructed languages have te potential to become natural languages if learned by native speakers and adopted by speech community (e.g. modern hebrew)
- must be learnable

## Language Modality
- _auditory-vocal/aural-oral/spoken languages_
	- misconception that language is inseparable from speech comes from interchanging terms speech and language
- _visual-gestural/signed languages_
	- usually used by those with hearing difficulties
	- an be acquired as a first language
	- other than modality, similar to spoken languages in every other way
	- misconceptions:
		- 1\. _signed language_ vs. _manual codes_: signed languages are NOT derived from spoken languages and evolve naturally and independently of spoken languages
			- British Sign Language & American Sign Language are unrelated
			- manual codes for spoken languages exist
			- true languages are more efficient than signed codes
		- 2\. _signed language_ vs. _pantomime_: false impression that signers draw pictures in air or act out the meaning
			- 2 misconceptions:
			- a\. signed languages don't have internal structure but governed by the same sorts of phonological, morphological, syntactic rules that govern spoken languages
			- b\. signed language words are completely iconic; if true, no need to learn
			- association signs to meanings are still arbitrary (even if iconic when introduced, evolved to become more arbitrary)
			- pantomime idea would restrict signed language from being able to communicate about abstract concepts
		- 3\. _universality of signed languages_ - there is NOT only one signed language
			- may come from the idea of the pantomime myth, where iconicity would lend itself to universality
	- when large enough proportion of a population is deaf, the rest are fluent in signing
	- hard to represent in 2D
- studying different modalities allow linguists to observe things such as minimum pause length in spoken language but no minimum pause in signed language


# Chapter 2: Phonetics
phonetics: consonants, vowels, melodies, rhythms
- figuring out which sounds are possible is critical

## Representing Speech Sounds
### 3 aspects:
1\. _articulary phonetics_ - study of production of speech sounds
- which sounds are possible?
- which parts of the mouth are used?
- use x-rays, EM articulograph receptors, ultrasound
- palatography to observe tongue/roof of mouth contact, airflow, air pressure

2\. _acoustic phonetics_ - study of transmission and physical properties of speech sounds
- concerns characteristics of sounds produced by articulations
- use sound spectrograph

3\. _auditory phonetics_ - study of perception of speech sounds
- how humans perceive pronunciation
- observe human responses to stimuli
- use MRI and CT
- impressionistic phonetic transcription
	- spelling is conventionalized to symbolize shared meaning, not pronunciation
	- avoid ambiguity:
		- each symbol should only represent on sound/phone & vice versa <c>
		- if two sounds can distinguish one word from another <th>
		- if two sounds very similar and difference comes from context, similarity should be represented <k> (_coarticulation_)
	- English is bad:
		- same sound is spelled using different letters
		- sometimes same letter has different sounds
		- sometimes single sound is spelled by combination of letters
		- sometimes single letter represents combination of sounds
		- sometimes letters don't represent any sound e.g. know, doubt, island
	- must be consistent and unambiguous 1-to-1 correspondence between sounds and symbols

### Types of Speech Sounds
1. _segments_
2. _suprasegmentals_

consonants vs. vowels

|  | consonants | vowels |
| - | ---------- | ------ |
| articulary  | produce constriction in vocal tract to impede airflow | slight narrowing & allow air to flow freely
| acoustically | usually less intense | usually more intense |
| auditory | - | prominent nucleus of each syllable |

- a _syllable_ can contains 1+ sounds & can be broken down into an _onset_ and a _rhyme_
- all syllables have a rhyme, but onset is optional in some languages
- _rhyme_ can be broken down into _nucleus_ and _coda_
- _vowels_ can be divided into 2 categories: _monophthongs_ and _diphthongs_

- _running speech_/_continuous speech_: we speak on a daily basis with words, phrases, sentences, run together
- pronunciation of words may be affected by surrounding words

## Articulation
focus on segmental features:
- voiced or voiceless?
- where is airstream constricted?
- how is airstream constricted?

3 components of human anatomy for speech production:
- larynx/voice box
- vocal tract
- subglottal system

_pulmonic egressive airstream mechanism_ - speech formed when exhaling

### Consonant Articulation
---
#### 1. Voicing
- _voiced sounds_ are created when the vocal cords vibrate; _voiceless sounds_ are created when the vocal cords don't vibrate
- vocal folds also don't vibrate in whispering
- observe _spectrogram_ & _voicing bar_
- view vocal folds directly with tiny camera

#### 2. Place of Articulation
place in vocal tract where airflow is constricted

| type | description | example |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **bilabial** | bring both lips close together | [p] pat <br> [b] bat <br> [m] mat <br> [w] with <br> [w̥] where (for some) |
| **labiodental** | lower lip against upper front teeth | [f] fat | [v] vat |
|**interdentals** | tip of tongue protruding between front teeth | [θ] thigh <br> [ð] thy |
| **alveolar** | tongue tip at or near front of upper _alveolar ridge_ | [t] tab <br> [d] dab <br> [s] sip <br> [z] zip <br> [n] noose <br> [ɾ] atom <br> [l] loose <br> [ɹ] red |
| **post-alveolar** | front of tongue just behind _alveolar ridge_, front of _hard palate_ | [ʃ] leash <br> [ʒ] measure <br> [ʧ] church <br> [ʤ] judge |
| **palatal** | body of tongue near center of _hard palate_ | [j] yes |
| **velar** | produced at _velum_ | [k] kill <br> [ɡ] gill <br> [ŋ] sing |
| **glottal** | produced when air constricted at larynx | [h] high <br> [ʔ] glottal stop between vowels or middle of words (cotton) |

_alveolar ridge_ - bony ridges of upper and lower jaws that contain sockets for teeth
_hard palate_ - hard portion of roof of mouth
_velum_/_soft palate_ - soft part of roof of mouth behind hard palate

#### 3. Manner of Articulation
how the airstream is constricted or modified in the vocal tract to produce the sound
- depends on degree of closure of articulators
- _stops_/_plosives_ completely obstruct airstream in oral cavity
- glottal stop occurs in larynx, not oral cavity

| type | description | example |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **fricatives** | form nearly complete obstruction in vocal tract, noise called _frication_ | [f] <br> [v] <br> [θ] <br> [ð] <br> [s] <br> [z] <br> [ʒ] <br> [h] |
| **affricates** | briefly stop airstream completely and then slightly releasing articulators to produce frication <ul><li>begin with stop and end with fricative</li></ul> | [ʧ] <br> [ʤ] |
| **nasals** | relax and lower velum, opening nasal passage to vocal tract | 'nasal stops' <br> [m] <br> [n] <br> [ŋ] |
| **approximants** | constrict vocal tract but not narrow enough to block vocal tract or cause turbulence; includes _liquids_ and _glides_ | |
| <ul><li>**liquids**</li></ul> | formed with slightly more constriction than glides; quality changes depending on where in word, usually voiced in English | [l] <br> [ɹ] (commonly _retroflex_)|
| <ul><li>**glides**</li></ul> | slight closure of articulators, close to vowel sounds; require some gliding of articulators during production | [w] <br> [w̥] <br> [j] |
| **flap**/tap | complete obstruction of oral cavity, but faster closure than a stop | [ɾ] <br> ('ladder' 'writer') |

[ɹ]: voiced, alveolar <br>
_retroflex_ - curling tip of tongue behind alveolar ridge

[w]: voiced, labial-velar glide
[w̥]: voiceless

- _syllabic consonants_: nasals and liquids can act as syllable nuclei
	- indicated by placing short vertical line below phonetic symbol
	- e.g.  [m̩], [l̩], [ɹ̩]

observing place and manner of articulation: **palatography** - picture where tongue touches roof of mouth during articulation
- _static palatography_: paint tongue black with mixture of olive oil and charcoal poweder
	- tongue leaves black trace wherever touched to make constriction when sound produced
	- only words if speaker produces single isolated sound and contact pattern photographed or examined immediately
- _dynamic palatography_: points of contact directly recorded on computer via artificial hard palate
	- can record sequences of contacts over course of an utterance
	- know place and duration of contact
	- hard to observe contact for soft palate region/velar consonants
- description typically voicing-place-manner

### Vowel Articulation
---
- consonants that surround vowels depend on it for audibility
- produced with open vocal tract, no place or manner of articulation (constriction), always voiced
- _low_ & _high_ vowels
- sound source is in vocal fold vibration, vocal tract acts as acoustic resonator, affecting quality of vowel
	- 4 main ways to change shape of vocal tract:
		- raising/lowering body of tongue
		- advancing/retracting body of tongue
		- rounding/not rounding lips
		- making movements with tense or lax gestures
- focus on monophthongs

#### English Vowel (Monophthong) Chart

![English Vowel (Monophthong) Chart](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/english-vowel-chart.gif)

#### 1. Tongue Height
| height | description | vowels |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ |
| high | raised tongue, front of mouth less open | [i] leak <br> [ɪ] lick <br> [u] Luke <br> [ʊ] look |
| mid | intermediate tongue height | [ɛ] bet <br> [ᴧ] but <br> [ɔ] bought <br> [ə] above |
| low | tongue lowered, front of mouth open | [æ] cat < br> [ɑ] cot |

most unstressed vowels pronounced as [ə] 

#### 2. Tongue Advancement
| place | description | vowels |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| front | tongue raised & pushed forward under hard palate | [i] seek <br> [ɪ] sick <br> [ɛ] sec <br> [æ] sack |
| central | no tongue advancement or retraction | [ᴧ] luck <br> [ə] another |
| back | tongue raised in back of mouth toward velum | [u] ooze <br> [ʊ] look <br> [ɔ] draw <br> [ɑ] dot |

#### 3. Lip Rounding
| | description | vowels |
| - | ----------- | ------ |
| rounded | lips are rounded | [u] loop <br> [ʊ] foot <br> [ɔ] paw |
| unrounded | lips are spread | [i] leak <br> [ɪ] lick <br> [ɛ] bet <br> [ᴧ] but <br> [ə] above <br> [æ] cat <br> [ɑ] cot |

#### 4. Tenseness
**tense** vowels have more extreme positions of tongue/lips than **lax vowels**
- more extreme tongue gestures from mid-central position to reach periphery of possible _vowel space_

| | |
| - | - |
| tense | [i] leak; [u] loop |
| lax | [ɪ] lick; [ʊ] foot; [ɛ] bet; [ᴧ] but; [ə] above; [ɔ] paw; [æ] cat; [ɑ] cot |

- diphthongs complex 2-part sounds, transition from one vowel to another in the same syllable
	- [ɑɪ] buy; [ɔɪ] boy; [oʊ] bow (performance); [eɪ] bay
