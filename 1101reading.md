**linguist** - someone who studies the structure of language and its use

**language** - an abstract cognitive system that uniquely allows humans to produce and comprehend meaningful utterances

**linguistic competence** - the unconscious knowledge a speaker has about his or her native language

**linguistic performance** - the observable use of language/actualization of one's linguistic knowledge

**performance error** - errors in language production or comprehension, including hesitations and slips of the tongue

**communication chain**: source, transmitter, signal, receiver, destination

**noise** - interference in the communication chain

**phonetics** - study of minimal units of language (sounds)

**phonology** - language-specific knowledge about the distribution of speech sounds
	allows you to recognize sounds and words spoken by different speakers

**morphology** - the study of how words are constructed out of morphemes

**syntax** - component of mental grammar that deals with constructing phrasal expressions out of smaller expressions; subfield of linguistics that studies how expressions can combine to form larger expressions

**'grammatical'** - correct grammar, according to descriptive grammar, esp syntax

**'ungrammatical'** - not following descriptive grammartical rules, esp syntax

**semantics** - study of linguistic meaning

**pragmatics** - study of how context affects language use, whether or not it is by chance in a context and how the context affects the utterance's meaning or interpretation

**lexicon** - mental repository of linguistic information about words and other lexical expressions, including their form and meaning and their morphological and syntactic properties;part of mental lexicon, including entries that capture relevant properties of lexical expressions

**language acquisition** - process by which children acquire lexicon and grammatical rules of language

**language variation** - property of languages having different ways to express the same meanings in different contexts, according to factors such as geography, social class, gender, social class, etc.

**writing** - physical representation of language other than speech; adds an extra step to communcation process

**form** - the structure or shape of any particular linguistic item, from individual segments to strings of words

**linguistic sign** - combination of form and meaning; connection between form and meaning is typically arbitrary

**formal language** - communication system that has both semantic and syntactic rules and that encodes ideas with symbols that represent particular meanings, but could never be the native language of a human

**natural language** - a language that has evolved naturally in a speech community

**constructed language** - a language that has been designed by an individual or group of individuals for some particular purpose, such as use in a fictional world or international communication, but did not originate as the native language of any speech community


## 3 Types of Grammar:
1) _mental grammar_
	- set of elements and rules of language system
	- rules that cannot be incorrect, despite differences from other speakers
2) _descriptive grammar_
	- objective description of a speaker's or group of speakers' knowledge of a language (competence) based on their use of the language (performance)
	- provides better picture of speaker's language competence
	e.g. some sentences end with preposition, some infinitives are split, some use double negatives
3) _prescriptive grammar_
	- a set of rules designed to give instructions regarding the socially embedded notion of the "correct" or "proper" way to speak or write
		e.g. don't end with preposition, don't split infinitives, don't use double negatives

## Knowing a Language:
1) recognizing sounds that are part of the language
2) breaking down words into parts with meaning or function
3) morphology
4) syntax - combine & form phrases
5) semantics - understanding & forming meaning

## Linguistic Competence:
1) lexicon
2) rules/mental grammar
	- _grammar_: language system, set of elements and rules (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics)
	- _rule_: statement of pattern that occurs in language, including how to combine sounds form 
	utterances

## Non-essential Aspects of Language:
1) _writing_
	- writing is less basic than speech:
		- writing must be taught
		- not all languages are written
		- neurolinguistic evidence - writing activates same parts of brain as speech + more
		- writing can be edited before sharing/ speech is spontaneous
		- archaeological evidence that writing came later than spoken language
	- why writing might be considered more 'perfect' than speech
		- can be edited - more organized, fewer errors, pauses
		- must be taught and associated with education
		- more physically stable
2) _prescriptive grammar_
	mark social identity & used for sical mobility
	easier for nonstandard dialect speakers to explicitly learn standard dialect

## Design Features of Language (Hockett)
- a set of 9 descriptive characteristics of language necessary for a communication system to be considered a language
- all systems have first 3, only human have last 2
1. mode of communication	e.g. voice, gestures
2. semanticity
	- property of having signals that convey a meaning, shared by all communiation systems
	- hear a word you don't know, assume it has meaning
3. pragmatic function
	- systems must serve useful purpose - help survival, influence others' behavior, exploring the world
4. interchangeability
	- ability of individuals to both transmit and receive messages
5. cultural transmission
	- aspects of language that can only be acquired via communicative interaction with other users
6. arbitrariness
	- refers to the fact that a word's meaning is not predictable from its linguistic form nor its meaning
	- nonarbitrariness: form represents meaning directly (iconic/picture-like)
		- evidence: cross-linguistic comparisons
		- onomatopoeia - a nonarbitrary aspect of language where the words imitate natural sounds or meaning is associated with nature
		- sound symbolism - phenomenon where certain sounds are evocative of a particular meaning
			e.g. 'small' have 'i' sound (teeny, wee, mikros);
				use high-pitched vowel because small objects give off high pitched sounds
		- speakers well-aware of nonarbitrary aspects and often used in poetry for example
7. discreteness
	- property of language that allows discrete units to be combined into larger communicative units
	- every language has limited number of sounds, but the ability to combine them in so many ways to express many ideas makes them useful
8. displacement
	- the ability of a language to communicate about things, actions, and ideas that aren't present in space or time while speakers are communicating (or just things that don't exist)
9. productivity
	- capacity of communication system for novel messages built out of discrete units to be produced and understood
	- differs from discreteness in that the units can be recombined into new messages and still be understood
	- understood because there are rules for how to put the sounds/morphemes/words together
	- rules at all levels of linguistic structure are productive & grant the ability to communicate about broad range of ideas

languages have all 9 parts, but does having them mke a communication system a language?
- formal languages aren't natural languages
- constructed languages have te potential to become natural languages if learned by native speakers and adopted by speech community (e.g. modern hebrew)
- must be learnable
