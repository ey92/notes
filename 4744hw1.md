### 2. All orthographic verbs that are also orthographic nouns
`define P1 [N&V];`

### 3. Map lower-case orthographic forms to upper-case orthographic forms
`define P2 [a<->{A}, b<->B, c<->C, d<->D, e<->E, f<->F, g<->G, h<->H, i<->I, j<->J, k<->K, l<->L, m<->M, n<->{N}, o<->O, p<->P, q<->Q, r<->R, s<->S, t<->T, u<->U, v<->{V}, w<->W, x<->X, y<->Y, z<->Z];`

### 4. 4-character orthographic verbs which are not orthographic nouns
`define P3 [?^4] & [V & [~N]];`

137 vs 871 paths (words), so yes, most 4-character verbs are also nouns

### 5. Strings consisting of at least one adjective, followed by a noun
`define P4 [[A^{ }]+] { } N;`

I included the space character in a set for a one-of-each regex to ensure spaces between words

### 6. Orthographic sequences which can be read as an adjective-noun combination in each direction, with no spaces
`define rmSpace { }->0;`

`define P5 [[[A N] .o. rmSpace].r & [[A N] .o. rmSpace]];`

Some nouns also contain apostrophes and dashes, in addition to spaces, which I did not remove from the function. This may reduce the number of results, since it is unlikely to have a contraction starting with an 's' and ending with something else.
- 1162 paths (I was surprised how many there are)

examples:
- worst rap / parts row
- murder alb / blare rum
- evil olive/ evil olive (palindrome!)

### 7. Set of CMU phonetic words
`define P6 CMU.l;`

### 8. Set of phonetic forms of adjectives
`define P7 [[A .o. P2] .o. CMU].l;`

### 9. Relation to devoice stop consonants
`define P8 [B->P, D->T, G->K];`

### 10. Relation to map lower-case orthographic nouns to a four-syllable phonetic transcription
#### syllables
`define vowels [AA0 | AA1 | AA2 | AE0 | AE1 | AE2 | AH0 | AH1 | AH2 | AO0 | AO1 | AO2 | AW0 | AW1 | AW2 | AY0 | AY1 | AY2 | EH0 | EH1 | EH2 | ER0 | ER1 | ER2 | EY0 | EY1 | EY2 | IH0 | IH1 | IH2 | IY0 | IY1 | IY2 | OW0 | OW1 | OW2 | OY0 | OY1 | OY2 | UH0 | UH1 | UH2 | UW0 | UW1 | UW2];`

`define Syl CMU.l & $[?*^vowels^?*^vowels^?*^vowels^?*^vowels^?*];`

`define P9 [P2 .o. CMU.l .o. Syl];`
- this gives a phonetic transcription of at least 4 syllables
	- create the set of all vowels
	- put wild cards (for syll)
- couldn't figure out how to limit the relation to no more than 4 syllables

attempted:

`define vowels [AA0 | AA1 | AA2 | AE0 | AE1 | AE2 | AH0 | AH1 | AH2 | AO0 | AO1 | AO2 | AW0 | AW1 | AW2 | AY0 | AY1 | AY2 | EH0 | EH1 | EH2 | ER0 | ER1 | ER2 | EY0 | EY1 | EY2 | IH0 | IH1 | IH2 | IY0 | IY1 | IY2 | OW0 | OW1 | OW2 | OY0 | OY1 | OY2 | UH0 | UH1 | UH2 | UW0 | UW1 | UW2];`

`define consonants [B | CH | D | DH | F | G | HH | JH | K | L | M | N | NG | P | R | S | SH | T | TH | V | W | Y | Z | ZH];`

`define Syl CMU.l & $[consonants*^vowels^consonants*^vowels^consonants*^vowels^consonants*^vowels^?*];`

`define P9 [P2 .o. CMU.l .o. Syl];`
- this took too long to run and crashed foma on my server, probably because there are too many combinations of consonants


### 11. Sonorant-only words
I took all the phonemes and removed the sonorants from the list. Then I looked for words that did not contain non-sonorants
`define P10 CMU.l .o. [~$"B" & ~$"CH" & ~$"D" & ~$"DH" & ~$"F" & ~$"G" & ~$"HH" & ~$"JH" & ~$"K" & ~$"P" & ~$"S" & ~$"SH" & ~$"T" & ~$"TH" & ~$"V" & ~$"Z" & ~$"ZH"];`

longest sonorants-only words (there are 2) are 11 letters:
- M AA2 N Y AH0 M EH1 N AH0 L IY0
- M AA2 N Y UW0 M EH1 N AH0 L IY0
- in orthographic form, both are the word "monolingual"
- on a guess, `regex P10 & [?^{10,100}];` gave me `2.3 kB. 12 states, 12 arcs, 2 paths.`
- on another guess, `regex P10 & [?^{15,100}];` gave me `160 bytes. 1 state, 0 arcs, 0 paths.`
- trying each integer length in between gave me two 11-letter words

### 12. Set of CMU orthographic words that end in ITY
`define P11 regex CMU.u & [?*^[I^T^Y]];`

### 13. Post & Answer a Challenge Question
#### Answered Challenge Question @62: The set of nouns that start and end with a fricative (in their phonetic forms).
https://piazza.com/class/jawwuwfbhk41ah?cid=62

Solution:

`define fricatives ["S" | "Z" | "SH" | "ZH" | "F" | "V" | "TH" | "DH"];`

`define fric CMU.l & [?*^fricatives] & [fricatives^?*];`
