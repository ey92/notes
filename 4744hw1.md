# 2. All orthographic verbs that are also orthographic nouns
`define P1 [N&V];`

# 3. Map lower-case orthographic forms to upper-case orthographic forms
`define P2 [a<->{A}, b<->B, c<->C, d<->D, e<->E, f<->F, g<->G, h<->H, i<->I, j<->J, k<->K, l<->L, m<->M, n<->{N}, o<->O, p<->P, q<->Q, r<->R, s<->S, t<->T, u<->U, v<->{V}, w<->W, x<->X, y<->Y, z<->Z];`

# 4. 4-character orthographic verbs which are not orthographic nouns
`define P3 [?^4] & [V & [~N]];`
137 vs 871 paths (words), so yes, most 4-character verbs are also nouns

# 5. Strings consisting of at least one adjective, followed by a noun
`define P4 [[A^{ }]+] { } N;`
I included the space character in a set for a one-of-each regex to ensure spaces between words

# 6. Orthographic sequences which can be read as an adjective-noun combination in each direction, with no spaces
`define rmSpace { }->0;
define P5 [[[A N] .o. rmSpace].r & [[A N] .o. rmSpace]];`
Some nouns also contain apostrophes and dashes, in addition to spaces, which I did not remove from the function. This may reduce the number of results, since it is unlikely to have a contraction starting with an 's' and ending with something else.
- 1162 paths -> I was surprised how many there are

examples:
- worst rap / parts row
- murder alb / blare rum

# 7. Set of CMU phonetic words
`define P6 CMU.l;`

# 8. Set of phonetic forms of adjectives
`define P7 [[A .o. P2] .o. CMU].l;`

# 9. Relation to devoice stop consonants
`define P8 [B->P, D->T, G->K];`
simi

## syllables
`define P9 [[P2 .o. CMU].l] & 
regex N .o. [~${e} & ~${a} & ~${i} & ~${u}];`

# 11. Sonorant-only words
I took all the phonemes and removed the sonorants from the list. Then I looked for words that did not contain non-sonorants
`define P10 CMU.l .o. [~$"B" & ~$"CH" & ~$"D" & ~$"DH" & ~$"F" & ~$"G" & ~$"HH" & ~$"JH" & ~$"K" & ~$"P" & ~$"S" & ~$"SH" & ~$"T" & ~$"TH" & ~$"V" & ~$"Z" & ~$"ZH"];`
longest sonorants-only word is 12 letters 
M AA2 N Y AH0 M EH1 N AH0 L IY0
M AA2 N Y UW0 M EH1 N AH0 L IY0

# 12. Set of CMU orthographic words that end in ITY
`define P11 regex CMU.u & [?*^[I^T^Y]];`

# 13.
