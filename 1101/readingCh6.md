# Chapter 6: Semantics
- linguistic meaning and how expressions convey meanings
- what are linguistic meanings and their relationship to language user and external world
- two types:
1. _lexical semantics_: meanings of words and lexical expressions
2. _compositional semantics_: phrasal meanings and how they are assembled
<br><br>
- finite number of words, but infinite different sentences
- two aspects of linguistic meaning:
	- _sense_: mental representation of an expression’s meaning
	- _reference_: component of linguistic meaning that relates the sense of some expression to entities in the outside world; collection of all referents of an expression
- _referent_: entities in the world to which some expressions point
- know sense to know reference, but doesn't guarantee ability to pick referent

## Lexical Semantics
- meanings of words
- dictionaries model word usage
- no higher authority on word meaning than community of native speakers
- words associated with senses

#### Defining Words
- **dictionary-style definition** requires understanding meaning of content and function words used in definition
- **mental image definition** word's meaning is stored as mental image - could be different for each speaker
	- default mental image tends to be typical or ideal example
		- _prototype_ - for any given set, a member that exhibits the typical qualities of the members of that set
	- many words have no clear mental images attached (e.g. abstract ideas)
- **usage-based definition** indisputable on how word's meaning is used in a sentence

#### Word References
- proper nouns (individual)
- common nouns (sets of individuals sharing characteristics)
- expressions containing nouns have specific referents, as a consequence of how meanings combine
- intransitive verbs - sets of entities
	- e.g. swim -> reference is all swimmers
- adjectives
	- e.g. purple -> all purple things

#### Meaning Relationships
- phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic word relationships
1. **hyponymy**: supersets and subsets
	- _hypernym_: color
	- _hyponym_: purple
	- _sister terms_ if reference on same level of hierarchy/same hypernym
2. **synonymy**: same reference
	- can have different sense
3. **antonymy**: opposite in some way; related meaning but contrasting in significant way
	- _complementary antonyms_: everything must be describable by one of the two words; not one means the other; mutually exclusive references
		- e.g. married/unmarried, existent/nonexistent, alive/dead, win/lose
	- _gradeable antonyms_/_gradeable pairs_/_scalar antonyms_: describes opposite ends of a scale
		- e.g. wet/dry, easy/hard, old/young, love/hate
	- _reverses_: one word in pair “undoes” the movement suggested by the other
		- e.g. put together/take apart, expand/contract, ascent/descent
	- _converses_: first word of pair suggests opposite point of view from second word
		- e.g. lend/borrow, send/receive, over/under, employer/employee
