# Chapter 8: Language Acquisition
- language sets humans apart from other animals
- suggested innate ability to use language
- native language: same stages
	- babbling
	- one word
	- two word
	- complex structures
- second language acquisition is very different

## Theories of Language Acquisition
**innateness hypothesis** - humans genetically predisposed to learn and use language
	- language is innate in humans
	- not a specific language
	- doesn't explain how language is acquired
	- born with knowledge that languages have patterns
	- born with ability to seek out and identify those patterns
	- potentially born with knowledge of _linguistic universals_ and _universal grammar_
- support
	- innate behaviors exhibited in all individuals of species, as opposed to learned behaviors
- characteristics of biologically controlled behaviors
	- behavior emerges before necessary
	- appearance not result of conscious decision
	- emergence not triggered by external events (surrounding environment must be sufficiently "rich" to develop adequately)
	- direct teaching and intensive practices have little effect
	- regular sequence of "milestones" as behavior develops; correlated with age or other aspects of development
	- likely _critical period_ for acquisition of behavior
- critical period
	- birth to beginning of puberty
	- child must be exposed to language to develop the necessary brain structures for language acquisition
	- support:
		- _neglected children_, _feral children_ (caveat: trauma, alternative communication system)
		- development of Idioma de Signos Nicaragense (ISN) by children with no exposure to other linguistic systems
	- includes second-language-acquisition
		- rather than a cut-off period, ability to learn declines

### Refuted Theories
#### Imitation Theory
- children learn language by listening to speech and reproducing what they hear
- memorize words and sentences
- somewhat true due to arbitrary association between sound and meaning
- refutation
	- children's speech differs from adult speech (where did they hear it from?) and full of errors
	- incorrectly applied morphology (would have predicted that children won't overgeneralize grammar/morphology rules)
	- does not acknowledge internal mental grammar
	- children and adults can produce and understand new sentences (no compositionality?; can't memorize every possible sentence bc infinite)

#### Reinforcement Theory
- children learn to speak like adults by being praised, rewarded, or otherwise reinforced when using the right forms and corrected when using the wrong forms
- refutation
	- corrections often have more to do with accuracy than grammar
	- grammar corrections fail entirely

### Competing Theories
- not all incompatible

#### Active Construction of a Grammar Theory
- children invent rules of grammar on their own by listening to speech
- most influential theory
- listen and analyze for patterns in speech, hypothesize rules for patterns
- once mental grammar matches adult's grammar, no significant discrepancies between forms from child vs. adult
- children's mistakes are expected to occur, follow non-random pattern
	- active reinforcement is not enough to fix errors
	- child must make amendments to grammar on its own

#### Connectionist Theories
- children by creating neural connections in the brain
- create connections by language exposure and use
- establish connections for every use heard (to word, phone, object, action)
	- build mental representation of meaning and form of word
- connections have different strengths, adjusted by experience
- instead of creating abstract rules, children exploit statistical information from linguistic input
- assumes:
	- input is rich enough to learn language without innate mechanism
	- statistical generalizations innate
- support: able to explain formation of (untaught) irregular forms
	- unexplained by Active Construction of a Grammar Theory

#### Social Interaction Theory
- children learn language via social interaction with older children and adults
- children prompt parents to provide appropriate language experience they need
	- require language environment to improve social and linguistic communication skills
	- appropriate language environment exists on cue from child
- children develop rules and have predisposition to learn language
- kind of input received by children is important; can't be just any language exposure
	- adult conversation with children is important
	- _child-directed speech_ slow, high-pitched, repetitions, simplified syntax, exaggerated intonation, simple and concrete vocabulary
		- varies across cultures, unsure which characteristics are important

## First-Language Acquisition: Acquisition of Speech Sounds and Phonology
### Physiological Sound Perception and Sound Production
- identify phonemes and allophones, dependent on context
- often able to identify distinctions before being able to produce them
- _High-Amplitude Sucking_
	- infants up to 6mo
	- infants sucking pacifier -> produce noise
	- when bored, change the noise produced
	- if sucking increases again, infant perceived the difference
- _Conditioned-Head-Turn Procedure_
	- infants 5-18 mo
	- 2 phases:
		- conditioning: associate change in sound with delayed activation of visual reinforcers (anticipation)
		- testing: infant look for visual reinforcers when perceive sound change
- at 4mo, distinguish vowels [ɑ] and [i] visually and aurally
- at 6mo, distinguish between phonemes in many language
- at 12 mo, only able to distinguish contrastive/phonemic sounds in native language
- intonational cues to segment language (e.g. stress on 1st syllable)
- learn _articulatory gestures_
- speech production much slower and variable development

### Babbling
- phase in child language acquisition where child produces meaningless sequences of consonants and vowels
- generally begins at 6mo
	- occurs when relevant structures in the brain reach critical level of development, regardless of physical limitations
- practice muscle coordination needed to produce language & provides social reward
- palatal and labial sounds likely
- **canonical/repeated babbling** at 7-10 mo
	- continuous repetition of sequences of vowels and consonants like [mamama] by infants
- **variegated babbling** at 10-12 mo
	- production of meaningless consonant-vowel sequences by infants
- similarities to language:
	- not linked to immediate biological needs (food, physical comfort)
	- often uttered in isolation or in pleasure
	- syllables identifiable in a sequence
	- often clear alternation between consonants and vowels
	- intonation patterns in longer sequences as questions
- no evidence for abstract structures like words or sentences

### Phonological Acquisition
- all children make errors while acquiring language
- errors are systematic and rule-governed
- adults analyze children's speech according to their own grammar
- important step: understanding link between word and meaning
	- at 18mo, children ask for names of objects in environments
	- much variability in production
	- treated as single sound
- vocabulary grows at 15-21 mo
	- learn to break up words into simpler units that can compose other words
- learn phonemes maximally distant from one another first ([mɑ],[pɑ)
	- prefer CV syllable structure/template
	- consonant clusters and syllable-final consonants later
	- final consonants often omitted
	- multi-syllable words much later, syllables often omitted
- use stress pattern to determine word boundaries

![Types of Speech Acts](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/1101/language-development-from-birth-to-12mo.png)

## First-Language Acquisition: Acquisition of Morphology, Syntax, and Word Meaning
- begin consistently producing words of native language beginning at 12 mo
- variance in stages doesn't indicate intelligence or quality of development

### One-Word/Holophrastic Stage
- children produce single word in isolation
	- typically name people, objects, pets - important/familiar parts of environment
	- next are verbs and useful words
- **holophrastic stage**: phrases used by adults become merged into one word

### Two-Word Stage
- 18-24 mo
- initially two one-word sentences
- begin to produce two words with single intonation pattern and without pausing
- sentence structure determined by semantic relationships
	- agent + action
	- action + object
	- action + location
	- entity + location
	- possessor + possession
	- entity + attribute
	- demonstrative + entity
- some diectic terms, some pronouns, 
- lack function morphemes and words
	- prepositions, auxiliary verbs, determiners, inflectional affixes
- **telegraphic**, content-based speech

### Later Stages of Development
- three-word utterances initially formed by combining or expanding two-word utterances
	- two two-word utterances share a common element
	- one word in two-word utterance becomes two words
- no clear three-word stage
- longer utterances syntactically organized
- still telegraphic speech
- function morphemes acquired in rather consistent order
	- verbs: -ing, -ed, -s
	- nouns: -s, -'s
	- articles: a, the
	- highly irregular verb forms much later
- _plurals_
	- initially copy adults
	- discover morpheme -s & apply to all nouns
	- _overgeneralization_ of morpheme
	- often leave sibilant-final nouns in singular form
	- learn -əz and temporarily replace all plural endings
	- sort environments, but irregular forms not learned by 5 yo
- _negatives_
	- initially sentence-initial "no"
	- insert negative word between subject and verb (no, not, can't, don't)
- _interrogatives_
	- easiest to produce by rising intonation instead of syntactic structure
	- at 3yo, use auxiliary verbs in yes/no questions
		- still struggle with wh-words & associated word order

### Acquisition of Word Meaning
- trial-and-error from example uses
- order of words learned reflects complexity of concept
- children's meanings of words are not random deviations
- _complexive concepts_
	- incorrect or incomplete set of unifying characteristics
	- try different characteristics with each use
	- create set of objects without unifying characteristic
- _overextensions_
	- extend word's meaning beyond typical use by adults
	- common properties usually perceptual features (e.g. shape, size, color, taste)
	- missing properties for definition
- _underextensions_
	- older children with category names
	- unsure of properties
	- defined by ordinary members of categories
	- fail to apply label to unusual members
- overgeneralizations decrease dramatically after 2yo, after rapid vocabulary expansion
- not all words involve identification of sets
- _relational terms_ present complex concepts
	- e.g. small/large involves absolute size of object in question and position on scale of similar objects
- _diectic terms_
	- refer to personal, temporal, or spatial apsects of an utterance
	- word's meaning depends on context of situation
	- no absolute distances to compare to
- verbs typically more complex concepts
	- inverse/converse happens and the same time from a different perspective, but only describe from one verb/perspective

## How Adults Talk to Young Children
- _child-directed speech_ slow, high-pitched, repetitions, simplified syntax, exaggerated intonation, simple and concrete vocabulary
	- influenced by 3 things
	- 1. ensure child understands utterance directed at child -> name, special tone, touch child
	- 2. choose concepts to maximize child's chances of understanding (child's current state/actions, but not philosophy)
	- 3. style of speaking most beneficial to child: quickly/slowly, long/short sentences

### How Adults Get Children to Pay Attention
- speakers depend on listeners to be cooperative and listening
- use _attention getters_ and _attention holders_
- 2 categories:
	- names and exclamations
	- modulations used to distinguish utterances addressed to young children
		- high pitch/wider pitch range
		- whisper/speak direcly into ears when nearby
		- gestures - look, point, motion

### What Adults Say to Young Children
- observe & impose cooperative principle
- make what they say relevant, usually about the "here" and "now"
	- commentaries of children's actions or future actions
	- talk about objects the children are interested in
	- assumptions
		- some words easier to pronounce for children than others
		- some words more useful for children than others
		- some words are hard to understand and should be avoided
	- most languages have "baby talk"
		- e.g. replace animal with sound
		- use diminutive form (for some words)
	- typically related to topics of young children
		- kinship terms, nicknames, animals, toys, games, bodily functions and routines, 
		- characterized by "level of utility"
	- adults tend to leave out function words and word endings
		- instead of using pronouns, repeat antecedent
- encourage turn-taking in conversation, even during 1st few months of life - burps, smiles, yawns, etc.
	- implicit and explicit information about conversational turns as soon as one-word and two-word stage
	- expand on topic introduced by child
	- prompt questions for child to answer
- make corrections
	- rarely correct child's contributions
	- usually semantic, as opposed to grammatical
	- focus on the truth value and intelligibility rather than the composition

### How Adults Talk to Children
- about half the speed of speech to adults
	- faster as children grow older
	- more pauses between words rather than stretching out words
- short sentences
- much repetition
	- provide structural information about how the repeated unit can be used
- speech intended for adults doesn't necessarily help children acquire language

## Bilingual Language Acquisition
- simultaneous bilingualism: child learns multiple languages from birth
- sequential bilingualism: child begins learning new language as a young child
- second-language acquisition - learn second language later in life

### Bilingual First-Language Acquisition
- if child receives sufficient input from two languages, grow up sufficiently bilingual with native proficiency in both
- children will become competent speaker of a language if at least 25% of input is in that language
	- learn by interacting with another speaker in that language
	- not enough to just hear speech
- bilingual children can differentiate languages at 4yo
- **language mixing/code-switching** is a typical feature of bilingual speakers' speech
	- happens when speaker knows audience also bilingual
	- potentially strategy to avoid words that are hard to pronounce

### Bilingual vs. Monolingual First-Language Acquisition
- bilingual children may lag in vocabulary, but are more advanced in concepts of abstractness
- catch up by puberty
- often only inhibited by environment, not brain's capabilities

### Second-Language Acquisition
- people who learn another language later in life usually attain different levels of competence
- learn syntax and vocabulary, but have difficulty with learning the entire phonological system
	- most have foreign accent
- non-native forms, as a result of morpho-syntax of pronunciation can become fixed and not change (_fossilization_)
- native language impacts how well speaker learns another language (_transfer_)
	- positive transfer - facilitates learning/negative transfer - inhibits learning
	- specialization of sounds for sounds in native language
- learning a second language requires having a native language
	- feral and deaf children are unable to pick up a new language later
- other factors: age, memory, motivation, context
