# Chapter 8: Language Acquisition
- language sets humans apart from other animals
- suggested innate ability to use language
- native language: same stages
	- babbling
	- one word
	- two word
	- complex structures
- second language acquisition is very different

## Theories of Language Acquisition
**innateness hypothesis** - humans genetically predisposed to learn and use language
	- language is innate in humans
	- not a specific language
	- doesn't explain how language is acquired
	- born with knowledge that languages have patterns
	- born with ability to seek out and identify those patterns
	- potentially born with knowledge of _linguistic universals_ and _universal grammar_
- support
	- innate behaviors exhibited in all individuals of species, as opposed to learned behaviors
- characteristics of biologically controlled behaviors
	- behavior emerges before necessary
	- appearance not result of conscious decision
	- emergence not triggered by external events (surrounding environment must be sufficiently "rich" to develop adequately)
	- direct teaching and intensive practices have little effect
	- regular sequence of "milestones" as behavior develops; correlated with age or other aspects of development
	- likely _critical period_ for acquisition of behavior
- critical period
	- birth to beginning of puberty
	- child must be exposed to language to develop the necessary brain structures for language acquisition
	- support:
		- _neglected children_, _feral children_ (caveat: trauma, alternative communication system)
		- development of Idioma de Signos Nicaragense (ISN) by children with no exposure to other linguistic systems
	- includes second-language-acquisition
		- rather than a cut-off period, ability to learn declines

### Refuted Theories
#### Imitation Theory
- children learn language by listening to speech and reproducing what they hear
- memorize words and sentences
- somewhat true due to arbitrary association between sound and meaning
- refutation
	- children's speech differs from adult speech (where did they hear it from?) and full of errors
	- incorrectly applied morphology (would have predicted that children won't overgeneralize grammar/morphology rules)
	- does not acknowledge internal mental grammar
	- children and adults can produce and understand new sentences (no compositionality?; can't memorize every possible sentence bc infinite)

#### Reinforcement Theory
- children learn to speak like adults by being praised, rewarded, or otherwise reinforced when using the right forms and corrected when using the wrong forms
- refutation
	- corrections often have more to do with accuracy than grammar
	- grammar corrections fail entirely

### Competing Theories
- not all incompatible

#### Active Construction of a Grammar Theory
- children invent rules of grammar on their own by listening to speech
- most influential theory
- listen and analyze for patterns in speech, hypothesize rules for patterns
- once mental grammar matches adult's grammar, no significant discrepancies between forms from child vs. adult
- children's mistakes are expected to occur, follow non-random pattern
	- active reinforcement is not enough to fix errors
	- child must make amendments to grammar on its own

#### Connectionist Theories
- children by creating neural connections in the brain
- create connections by language exposure and use
- establish connections for every use heard (to word, phone, object, action)
	- build mental representation of meaning and form of word
- connections have different strengths, adjusted by experience
- instead of creating abstract rules, children exploit statistical information from linguistic input
- assumes:
	- input is rich enough to learn language without innate mechanism
	- statistical generalizations innate
- support: able to explain formation of (untaught) irregular forms
	- unexplained by Active Construction of a Grammar Theory

#### Social Interaction Theory
- children learn language via social interaction with older children and adults
- children prompt parents to provide appropriate language experience they need
	- require language environment to improve social and linguistic communication skills
	- appropriate language environment exists on cue from child
- children develop rules and have predisposition to learn language
- kind of input received by children is important; can't be just any language exposure
	- adult conversation with children is important
	- _child-directed speech_ slow, high-pitched, repetitions, simplified syntax, exaggerated intonation, simple and concrete vocabulary
		- varies across cultures, unsure which characteristics are important

## First-Language Acquisition: Acquisition of Speech Sounds and Phonology
### Physiological Sound Perception and Sound Production
- identify phonemes and allophones, dependent on context
- often able to identify distinctions before being able to produce them
- _High-Amplitude Sucking_
	- infants up to 6mo
	- infants sucking pacifier -> produce noise
	- when bored, change the noise produced
	- if sucking increases again, infant perceived the difference
- _Conditioned-Head-Turn Procedure_
	- infants 5-18 mo
	- 2 phases:
		- conditioning: associate change in sound with delayed activation of visual reinforcers (anticipation)
		- testing: infant look for visual reinforcers when perceive sound change
- at 4mo, distinguish vowels [ɑ] and [i] visually and aurally
- at 6mo, distinguish between phonemes in many language
- at 12 mo, only able to distinguish contrastive/phonemic sounds in native language
- intonational cues to segment language (e.g. stress on 1st syllable)
- learn _articulatory gestures_
- speech production much slower and variable development

### Babbling
- phase in child language acquisition where child produces meaningless sequences of consonants and vowels
- generally begins at 6mo
	- occurs when relevant structures in the brain reach critical level of development, regardless of physical limitations
- practice muscle coordination needed to produce language & provides social reward
- palatal and labial sounds likely
- **canonical/repeated babbling** at 7-10 mo
	- continuous repetition of sequences of vowels and consonants like [mamama] by infants
- **variegated babbling** at 10-12 mo
	- production of meaningless consonant-vowel sequences by infants
- similarities to language:
	- not linked to immediate biological needs (food, physical comfort)
	- often uttered in isolation or in pleasure
	- syllables identifiable in a sequence
	- often clear alternation between consonants and vowels
	- intonation patterns in longer sequences as questions
- no evidence for abstract structures like words or sentences

### Phonological Acquisition
- all children make errors while acquiring language
- errors are systematic and rule-governed
- adults analyze children's speech according to their own grammar
- important step: understanding link between word and meaning
	- at 18mo, children ask for names of objects in environments
	- much variability in production
	- treated as single sound
- vocabulary grows at 15-21 mo
	- learn to break up words into simpler units that can compose other words
- learn phonemes maximally distant from one another first ([mɑ],[pɑ)
	- prefer CV syllable structure/template
	- consonant clusters and syllable-final consonants later
	- final consonants often omitted
	- multi-syllable words much later, syllables often omitted
- use stress pattern to determine word boundaries
