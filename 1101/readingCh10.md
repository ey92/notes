# Chapter 10: Language Variation
- languages have **internal variation** & every speaker has their own **idiolect**

## Language Varieties
- **sociolinguistics** - study of interrelationships of language and social structure
- **dialect** - variety of language defined by geographical & social factors (class, religion, ethnicity)
	- "pure" dialects are extremely unlikely, occur as result of **communicative isolation**
	- **mutual intelligibility** used to distinguish between dialects and languages
- **accent** - systematic phonological variation
- **speech community** - group of people speaking the same dialect
	- defined by **extralinguistic factors**
- **dialect continuum** in Europe
- **speech style/register** - way of speaking marked by degrees of formality
	- **style shifting** - automatically switching between styles
- **jargon/technical language** differs in lexical terms
- **slang** - utilizes stylistic choices of vocabulary, less formal
	- **common slang** - everyday language just too informal for letters of application
	- **in-group slang** - specialized slang to particular group of people at a particular time
	- result of need to be creative in language use

### Standards and Prestige
- **standard dialect** - variety of a language that is used by political leaders, the media, and speakers of higher socioeconomic classes and that is taught in schools; the variety of a languages associated with (overt) prestige
	- idealizations, not well-defined
- **nonstandard dialects** - any variety of a language not considered to be representative of the prestige or standard variety
	- most stigmatized, considered unsystematic & illogical
- **prescriptive standard** - standard by which a society makes judgments of “right” or “wrong”
- **hypercorrection**: producing nonstandard forms by false analogy
- _Received Pronunciation (RP)/BBC English/Queen's English_: pronunciation and grammar marked by elites

## Variation at Different Levels of Linguistic Structure
- variation at all levels of language
- phonetic variation
- phonological variation
	- rhotic vs non-rhotic dialects
- morphological variation
	- "-ish" vs. "-like"
- syntactic variation
	- syntactic categories & their syntactic properties
- lexical variation
	- pop vs soda

## Factors Influencing Variation: Regional and Geographic Features
- regional and geographic factors influence variation
- **regional dialect** - variety of language defined by region or geography
- **social dialect** - variety of a language defined by social factors such as age, religion, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status
- **regional variation** - internal variation of a language based on region or geography
	- people who live close to one another and communicate more will influence each other more
	- geographic barriers create natural barriers for communication, resulting in less contact
- **dialectologist** - person who studies regional dialects and regional variation
- **isogloss** - line drawn on a dialect map marking the boundary of an area where a particular linguistic feature is found
	- **bundle of isoglosses** - set of isoglosses surrounding the same geographic region or distinguishing the same group of speakers, marking a particular language variety
- **Northern Cities Shift** - systematic rotation of the vowel space found in speakers in the northern region of the United States
- South: double modal
- Appalachia: a-prefixing, multiple negation
- Midland: /l/-vocalizaion, near merger, near-homophones
- West: generally hybrid pronunciation, but Northern grammar

## Factors Influencing Variation: Social Factors
- socioeconomic variation
	- show solidarity with particular socioeconomic group or difference from another group
	- associated with levels of education
	- NYC r-drop in poorer areas
- age variation
	- younger generation introduces new word uses or sentence structure
- gender variation
	- depends on culture
	- direct/indirect speech, confrontational, public speech, quietness
	- usually tied to social roles that each gender plays
- **community of practice** - group of people who come together to share some activity or lifestyle
- ethnic variation
	- pronunciations, words, and constructions from ethnic group's original language
	- compounded with identity
	- African American English (AAE)
		- monophthongization before voiced consonants or word final
		- final consonant cluster reduction
		- absence of 3PS -s suffix
		- habitual be
	- Chicano English 
		- many 3rd-gen, little fluency in Spanish
		- symbolically reference Latino and Hispanic cultural heritage & identity
		- /oʊ/ -> /o/, /ɪŋ/ -> /iŋ/, /ɑ/ -> /ɔ/ (Spanish only has 5 monophthong vowels)
		- simple past tense forms
		- topicalization
	- Lumbee English
		- Native Americans east of Mississippi
		-  /ɑɪ/ -> /ɔɪ/
		- word-final [ɹ]
		- tobacco/baccer, potato/tater (syl reduction)
		- habitual be
		- unique lexical items

## Language and Identity
- language to signal identity & associate with certain groups
- social stereotypes
	- British -> educated
	- Southern -> uneducated
- difficult to predict language use from social background
