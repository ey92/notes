# Chapter 9: Psycholinguistics
- _psycholinguistics_: how linguistic processes are carried out in the mind as we produce and comprehend language
- _neurolinguistics_: language and the physical brain
- find language centers of the brain

## Language and the Brain
- study with experimental imaging techniques & people with brain disorders
- **right hemisphere**
	- processing music and perceiving nonlinguistic sounds
	- performing tasks that require visual and spatial skills or pattern recognition
	- receives and controls nerve input from the left half of the body
- **left hemisphere**
	- contains most language-controlling parts
	- receives and controls nerve input from the right half of the body
- **temporal lobe**
	- perception and recognition of auditory stimuli
- **frontal lobe**
	- area of the brain concerned with higher thinking and language production
- **occipital lobe**
	- area of the brain associated with many aspects of vision
- **parietal lobe**
	- area of the brain that is least involved in language perception and production
- **corpus callosum**
	- bundle of nerve fibers in the brain that is the major connection between the two hemispheres
	- partially severed in split-brain patients
- **cortex**
	- outer surface of the brain responsible for many of brain’s cognitive abilities or functions
	- _gyrus_: bumps
	- _fissure_: depressions
	- **Sylvian Fissure** - large horizontal fold in the middle of each hemisphere separating  temporal lobe from frontal lobe

![brain language centers](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/1101/brain-language-centers.png)

- **language centers**
	- parts of the cortex of the brain used in production and comprehension of language
	- _interior frontal gyrus (IFG)/Broca's Area_
		- lower portion of the frontal lobe
		- directs _motor cortex_ (posterior of frontal lobe)
	- _superior temporal gyrus (STG)_
		- upper portion of the temporal lobe
		- left STG process sound, map physical sounds to linguistic phones
	- _Sylvian parietotemporal area (SPT)/Wernicke's Area_
		- grouped with posterior STG
		- region at juncture of the parietal and temporal lobes
	- _middle temporal gyrus (MTG)_
		- middle portion of the temporal lobe
		- left MTG process word meaning
	- _inferior temporal gyrus (ITG)_
		- lower portion of the temporal lobe
		- ITG process word meaning

### Processing
![hw10 brain areas](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/1101/hw10-brain-areas.jpg)

- **auditory cortex**
	- in STG, both hemispheres
	- process sound
- **Sylvian Parietotemporal Area/Wernicke's area**
	- left SPT convert phonological/auditory into articulatory-motor representations
- **inferior frontal gyrus/Broca's Area**
	- left IFG organize articulatory representations of language
	- coordinate motor commands for speech
- **angular gyrus**
	- in SPT and visual cortex
	- convert visual into linguistic stimuli & vice versa

### Connectivity
- 2 key pathways composed of white matter
- **dorsal pathway** - connects SPT with IFG via arcuate fasciculus
	- **arcuate fasciculus** - share phonetic and phonological information
- **ventral pathway** - connects STG and MTG/ITG with IFG via extreme capsule
	- **extreme capsule** - analyze semantics of incoming speech & aid syntactic processing

![brain connecting pathways](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/1101/connecting-pathways.png)

### Produce Spoken Word
| brain region | responsibility |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| MTG/ITG | access lexicon <br> interpret lexical entry |
| arcuate fasciculus | phonetic information MTG/ITG to IFG/Broca's area |
| IFG | interpret phonetic information received <br> transmit articulatory information to motor cortex |
| motor cortex | direct muscle movement for articulation |

### Hearing Spoken Word
| brain region | responsibility |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| auditory cortex | process information received by ears |
| extreme capsule | semantic information auditory cortex to MTG/ITG |
| MTG/ITG | interpret auditory stimulus and match information to lexical entry |

### Reading Written Word
| brain region | responsibility |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| visual cortex | process information perceived by eyes |
| angular gyrus | associate written form of word with lexical entry |
| MTG/ITG | lexical access <br> meaning and pronunciation of word |

### Lateralization
- specialization of brain hemispheres for cognitive functions
- happens early in childhood
- can be reversed if damage to brain early
- **neural plasticity** - brain can account for damage in one region by reassigning processing functions to another region
- **contralaterality** - one side of the body is controlled by the opposite hemisphere of the brain

### Tasks and Experiments
- **dichotic listening task** - play different sounds to different ears simultaneously; have participant pick which one was heard (linguistic or not)
	- right ear: verbal; left ear: nonverbal
- **split-brain patient** - individual whose corpus callosum has been surgically disconnected (previously to treat epilepsy)
	- fail to verbally name object in right hand
	- proof for contralaterality
- **hemispherectomy** - remove part of all of a hemisphere of brain
	- remove left hemisphere -> more frequent aphasia -> left hemisphere language processing
	- evidence for language centers

## Language Disorders
- **aphasia** - damage to brain caused inability to perceive, process, or produce language
- _anosognosia_ (unable to recognize they have aphasia)

| type of aphasia | damaged area | effects | anosognosia/unaware? |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------- | ------------ |
**Broca's Aphasia** | IFG | - understanding fine<br>- inability to plan motor speech/sigh sequences<br>- poor articulation<br>- lack of fluency<br>- telegraphic speech<br>- lack function words, morphological inflections<br>-lack linguistic facial expression/rich in affective facial expressions (signing) | |
| **Wernicke's Aphasia** | SPT and STG | - cannot understand & answer well<br>- has fluency<br>- semantically incoherent speech<br>- words well-formed, little content<br>- circumlocutions: round-about description, not concise<br>- has linguistic facial expression/lack affective facial expression (signing) | yes |
| **conduction aphasia** | STG | - inability to repeat what someone just said<br>- can comprehend others' speech<br>- make characteristic phonological errors in their own speech, especially when trying to repeat others' speech | no |
| **alexia** (acquired dyslexia) | angular gyrus | - inability to read and comprehend written words | |
| **agraphia** | angular gyrus | - inability to write written words | |

- **developmental dyslexia** - learned inability to read fluently
- **affective facial expressions** - facial expression that conveys an emotion such as sadness, happiness, anger, fear, surprise, etc
- **linguistic facial expressions** - non-manual marker
- genetic disorders, separation of language/other cognitive abilities
	- **Specific Language Impairment (SLI)** - disorder that affects the way people process language and other quickly changing stimuli
		- impaired language, despite average performance on nonvebal intelligence tests
	- **Williams Syndrome** - disorder due to deletion of genes on chromosome 7
		- impaired cognitive function; language processing relatively intact

## Speech Production
- processes involved in producing speech and sign
- serial model - steps happen in succession
- parallel model - steps happen simultaneously and influence each other

### Fromkin's Model
1. Meaning identified
2. Syntactic structure selected
3. Intonation contour generated
4. Content words inserted
5. Function words and affixes inserted
6. Phonetic segments specified

### Levelt's Model
- Conceptualization
- Formulation:
	- grammatical encoding (syntactic frame & lexicon)
	- phonological encoding (specific phonetic phone)
- Articulation
- allows positive feedback in both directions

### Factors Affecting Speech Production
- access more frequent/familiar words faster
- word length probably not large effect
- _phonetic reduction_ - phonetic details reduced, phones shortened/dropped
	- more common words predictable from context

### Production Errors
**production error** unintentional errors
	- relate to production process, not knowledge of language
- can provide evidence for psychological reality of linguistic concepts
	- phone articulation
	- allophony
	- phonotactic constraints
	- morphology
	- syllable existence & structure
	- organization of mental lexicon
- provide support for speech production models
	- affixes on the wrong words -> affixes after content words chosen
- **lexical bias effect** - phonological errors give rise to real words more often than chance would predict
	- often catch ourselves just after making speech error
	- use **propioception** (sence of body parts' locations & motions)

#### Slips of the Tongue
- **anticipation** - later unit substituted for earlier unit or added in earlier
- **persevaration** - earlier unit substituted for later unit or added later
- **addition** - addition of extra units for no reason
- **deletion** - omission of units for no reason**
- **metahesis** - switch two units in each others' place
	- **spoonerism** - metathesis with first sounds of separate words
- **shift** - unit moved from one location to another
- **subsitution** - one unit replaced with another
	- **malapropism** - substitution with semantically incorrect word instead of phonetically similar word
- **blend** - two words "fuse" into single item

| Intended Utterance | Actual Utterance | Error Type |
| splicing from one tape | splacing from one tape | anticipation |
| splicing from one tape | splicing from one type | perseveration |
| spic and span | spic and splan | addition |
| his immortal soul | his immoral soul | deletion |
| fill the pool | fool the pill | metathesis |
| dear old queen | queer old dean | spoonerism |
| she decides to hit it | she decide to hits it | shift |
| it’s hot in here | it’s cold in here | substitution |
| grizzly/ghastly | grastly | blend |

#### Slips of the Hand
- proves existence of parameters
- motions, hand shapes, etc
