# Chapter 3: Phonology
phonetics vs phonology
- phonetics is study of physical production of speech sounds
	- vocal tract, articulatory & acoustic properties
- phonology is study of language organization of speech sounds
	- how are they organized and interact
	- distinguishing between words

## Phonotactic Constraints and Foreign Accents
-languages with the same _phonetic inventory_ can sound differently due to differing _phonotactic constraint_
- languages prefer syllables to begin with CV_ (one consonant, one vowel)
- English allows up to three consonants to start a word, doesn't start with [ʒ ŋ]
- certain segments can't follow each other (fk)
- in ASL, monosyllabic sign must change handshape, location, or orientation
- dominant/non-dominant hand conventions
- foreign accents
	- apply native phonotactic constraints to new language's words
	- replace phones that don't exist in native phonetic inventory (_sound substituion_)

## Phonemes and Allophones
- which sound patterns are variants of "same" sound and which are significant differences?
- [p] and [pʰ] _contrastive_ in Hindi: swapping will change definition
- top [t], little [ɾ], and kitten [ʔ] are _noncontrastive_ in English: interchanging different  versions of “same” sound, since enunciating with [t] doesn't change meaning
- _aspiration_: stop [t] vs top [t]
	- puff of air follows release of consonant delay in voice onset
- [t, tʰ, ɾ, ʔ] phonetically different but phonologically the same

![Phonemes and Allophones](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/1101/phonemes-allophones.png)

- **phoneme** - set of speech sounds that a variants of the same sound (abstract)
	- /t/
- **allophone** - a phonetic segment in a phoneme set (concrete)
	- [t, tʰ, ɾ, ʔ]
- English spelling represents phonemes, not phonetic segments (general trend)

### Distribution of Speech Sounds
- _distribution_ - set of phonetic environments in which sound occurs
	- _contrastive distribution_: two sounds occur in the same phonetic environment
		- identified by finding a _minimal pair_ - two words that differ only by a single sound the same position and have different meanings
		- cot [k] & got [g], lid [d] & lit [t]
	- _complementary distribution_: two sounds never occur in same phonetic environment
		- no minimal pair
		- allophones of same phoneme
		- [i] before [d, p, ɹ, t], word end
		- [ĩ] before [n, m]
	- _free variation_: multiple pronunciations/phones for given sound without changing word meaning
	- _overlapping distribution_: sounds occur in same environment
- _phonetic environment_ - sound that comes before and after a particular sound in a word
- phonetic environments of 2+ sounds -> distribution

| | contrastive sounds | allophonic sounds | free variation |
| - | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| relation to phonemes | allophones of separate phonemes | allophones of same phoneme | allophones of same phoneme |
| distribution predictability | unpredictable | predictable | unpredictable |
| how to recognize | - contrastive distribution <br> - minimal pairs <br> - overlapping distribution with differences in meaning | complementary distribution | overlapping distribution with no difference in meaning

### Implicational Laws
- some sounds [p t a] are more common in languages than others [ħ ʕ]
- **implicational law**: observation about language universals that takes the form of an implication
	- if language uses a less common sound, one of its more common counterparts will also be used
	- voiceless consonants more common than voiced consonants
	- if language has a fricative, it also has stop in the same place of articulation

| less common | more common |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [ã] | [a] |
| [ḁ] | [a] |
| [x] | [k] or [s] |
| [s] | [t] |
| [d] | [t] |
| [ð] | [d] or [z] |
| voiced stops | voiceless stops |
| fricatives in place X | stops in place X |

- frequency & range of distribution
- acquisition of sounds: children learn common sounds first and substitute them for less common sounds
- sound change: less common sounds are less stable
- use _maximally distinct_ consonants and vowels to avoid confusion in conveying message

## Challenges of Phonology
- different for each language
- minute differences to observe unnoticed by native speakers & can't be physically determined
- absence of minimal pairs doesn't necessarily imply that two phones are allophones of same phoneme
	- if no generalization can be made, probably contrastive and allophones of different phonemes
- using **near-minimal pairs**
- allophonic variation results from application of phonological rules

### Phonemic Analysis
1. look at natural environments to find natural classes
2. look for complementary gaps in environments
3. state a generalization about the distribution of each of the sounds
4. determine the identity of the phoneme and its allophones
	- determine _restricted allophone_ and _basic allophone_
