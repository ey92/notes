# Chapter 3: Phonology
phonetics vs phonology
- phonetics is study of physical production of speech sounds
	- vocal tract, articulatory & acoustic properties
- phonology is study of language organization of speech sounds
	- how are they organized and interact
	- distinguishing between words

## Phonotactic Constraints and Foreign Accents
-languages with the same _phonetic inventory_ can sound differently due to differing _phonotactic constraint_
- languages prefer syllables to begin with CV_ (one consonant, one vowel)
- English allows up to three consonants to start a word
- certain segments can't follow each other (fk)
- in ASL, monosyllabic sign must change handshape, location, or orientation
- dominant/non-dominant hand conventions
- foreign accents
	- apply native phonotactic constraints to new language's words
	- replace phones that don't exist in native phonetic inventory (_sound substituion_)
