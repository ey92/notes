# Chapter 13: Language Change
- all languages change over time, unless they are dead (no native speakers)
- language family - group of related languages, in the sense that they come from common origins
	- compare languages, dialects, historical stages, and history of languages

#### Synchronic vs Diachronic Linguistics
- not the result of moral corruption or intellectual deterioration
- _synchronic analysis_ - analysis of a language at a particular point in time
- _diachronic analysis_ - analysis of language change through time
<br><br>
- numerous ways for language variation
- tied to many social factors, language changes with society
- large amount of variation allows more choices for creating utterances
- _historical linguistics_: study of how languages change through time; the study of how languages are historically related to one another
- _Proto-Indo-European (PIE)_

causes for language change:
- loss of homogeneity due to geographical division
	- intrinsic variation between speakers is compounded by geographical or social barriers
- language contact
	- languages in contact with each other tend to show similarities
	- borrow words

## Language Relatedness
- many languages use the same sounds because humans are anatomically similar
- coincidental similar meanings ways of expressing same meaning
- iconic connection between form and meaning (e.g. onomatopoeia)
- language contact
- "genetically similar"/ same ancestor language
	- _relatedness hypothesis_
- telling relatedness:
	- avoid onomatopoeia, be wary of coincidence
	- compare large vocabulary
	- core vocabulary and grammatical function words tend not to change
	- look for cognates and systematic differences

#### Models of Language Relatedness
- notion of a _protolanguage_
	- Sir William Jones
	- relation between Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, and Latin
	- influenced by Darwin
- _family tree theory_ 
	- August Schleicher
	- assumes speech sounds change in regular, recognizable ways
		- _regularity hypothesis_: assumption that speech sounds change in regular, recognizable ways
	- phonological similarities among languages may be due to genetic relationship among languages
	- may lead to misconceptions that daughter languages abruptly broke off without intermediate stages
- _wave theory_
	- supplement family tree model
	- Johannes Schmidt
	- recognizes gradual spread of change, as a wave expands on surface of pond, at different rates
- 141 language families
- no language is uniform or isolated from others

## Sound Change
- alteration in the phonetics of a sound as a result of phonological processes
- most studied aspect of language change
- impossible to understand changes in other areas of language system without sound change
- provides basis for study of language relationships and reconstruction of parent/proto-languages
- introduction of phonological process in a language
	- 1st step to sound change
	- alone is not enough to be considered a sound change
	- changes structure of word in specific speech contexts
- in sound change, basic form of a word mush be permanently altered in all contexts
	- no more choice between variants

#### Phonetic vs Phonological Change
- **phonetic change** refers to change in pronunciation of an allophone that has no effect on the phonological system of the language
- **phonological change** changes the phonological system in some way, by the addition or loss of a phoneme or by a change in the distribution of allophones
<br><br>
Regularity of Sound Change
- every instance of the sound in question will change (_regular change_)
- some sound changes are not regular
	- dissimilation, insertion, metathesis

#### Types of Sound Change
- _unconditioned sound change_ - sound change that occurs without influence from neighboring sounds
- _conditioned sound change_ - sound change that occurs under the influence of nearby sounds (condition based on context)
1. **Assimilation**: one sound becomes more like another sound
	- voiceless fricatives become voiced when between voiced sounds
	- wulfas [wulfas] -> [wulvas]
	- f/v alternation
2. **Dissimilation**: two similar sounds become less alike
	- second voiceless fricative replaced by voiceless stop
	- fifth [fɪfθ] -> [fift] (not yet regular)
3. **Deletion**: sound no longer pronounced
	- nose [nɔːzə] -> [noʊz] (conditional [ə] at end)
4. **Insertion**: sound added to pronunciation of word
	- athelete [æθlit] -> [æθəlit] (conditional [ə] inserted between [θ] and [l])
5. **Monophthongization**: change from diphthong to monophthong
	- law [laʊ] -> [lɔ] (unconditional change, happened in every instance of [aʊ])
6. **Diphthongization**: change from monophthong to diphthong
	- house [huːs] > [hɑʊs] (unconditional change, all instances of [iː] also affected)
7. **Metathesis**: change in order of sounds
	- C/r/VC -> CV/r/C, conditioned on /r/ between consonants
	- hros, frist, thridde, bridd -> horse, first, third, bird
8. **Raising**/**Lowering**: change in tongue height in vowel production
	- noon [noːn] -> [nuːn] (unconditional change)
	- most raising is conditional on neighboring higher or lower vowels
9. **Backing**/**Fronting**: alternation in position of tongue in vowel production
	- [ɑ]->[æ] calf/path/glass/past/ask (unconditional change)
