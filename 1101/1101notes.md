# Intro
**language** is a system of rules mapping sounds/gestures and meanings
- mostly compositional
- idioms noncompositional

**grammar**
- descriptive grammar (observations)
- prescriptive grammar (guidelines how to construct phrases)
- mental grammar: set of rules for how to build words and sentences

fluency: lexicon + mental grammar

**morpheme**: "minimal strings of sounds associated with fixed meanings"
- may be words, but they may be smaller than words
-connection between sounds of a word and its meaning is mostly arbitrary
except
	* onomatopoeia
	* sound symbolism

sound instead of writing: humans have had language from the beginning 50,000yrs
- only literate about 5,000yrs
- infrequency of developing independent writing systems
- -> writing not central to language
- graphical way of representing sounds

representing sounds in writing
- no 'th' letter - multiple sounds for 'th'
- many letters have multiple sounds
- why use 2+ letters to represent sound?

**International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)**
- 1888
- phonetic alphabet with characters having simple, consistent sounds, based on the Roman alphabet
- one sound per character
- one character for every sound used distinctively in some language
- advantage of universality

**acoustic phonetics**: analysis of speech sounds in their physical aspect
_spectrograms_ produce graphs(_spectographs_) which map the _frequency_ (pulse/second) and intensity (_amplitude_) of vibrations over time


# Phonetics
## Phonetics 28/1
### Design features of language
- open-ended due to compositionality
- rule-governed
- mental grammars are generative
- rule-governed creativity -> understand new sentences; potentially infinite set of linguistic objects
- at each level, you can look at the objects that make up language from two different perspectives
	* **paradigmatic relationships** - what the chunks are, what categories they belong to
	* **syntagmatic relationships** - how they are put together (order, which ones work together)
- rules of grammar create 2D objects
	* language has linear order
	* but also hierarchical structure
- at level of sounds
	* phonetic features -> sound segments -> segments -> syllables, feet
	* **morphemes**: strings of sounds associated with fixed meanings, combine to form words usually ordered one after another
	* **free morphemes** - can stand by themselves as words
	* **bound morphemes** - can only occur in combination
- **word** - a free morpheme with all the bound morphemes attached to it
	*can a word be only made from bound morphemes?
- words -> phrases -> sentences

languages are learnable

---
**articulatory phonetics** - looks at the way sounds are formed in the human vocal tract
- "high-front vowel /i:/" vs "high-back vowel /u:/" vs "low vowel /a:/"
- physical position in mouth

**acoustic phonetics** - concerned with physical analysis of the speech sound
- _sound spectrogram_ (waveform) time x frequency
- _formant_ - uniform band of relatively great intensity in the sound spectrum over a particular frequency range

**perceptual phonetics** - concerned with the mechanisms of speech perception in the ear and the brain
- physical disturbances of air vibrating ear

separate from grammar: describes the physical/physiological phenomena outside the speaker's mind


### Consonants & Vowels
**consonants** involve some degree of obstruction of airflow
- **stop consonants** completely cut off airflow (hear consonant when air is released): t,g,b,p,m
	* on spectrogram: blank/d
- **fricative consonants** restrict airflow enough to create turbulence: f,v,th
**vowels** do not obstruct airflow but more concerned about the shape of the mouth

_semivowels_ /j/ /w/ phonetically (articulatorily and acoustically) vowels /ɪ/ /ʊ/

Classifying Sounds
- egressive pulmonary sounds - begin with airflow from lungs
	* airflow passes through the larynx and ca be modified by vocal cords in larynx

larynx is dangerously close to esophagus opening
- protected by epiglottis
- gives more room to articulate more sounds

voicing
- **vocal bands** - two muscular folds inside larynx which vibrate with each other when close together
- **voiced sounds** - sounds articulated with vocal cords
- **whispering**: holding back part of vocal cords apart
- **glottal stops** - created by momentarily closing the vocal cords

#### Articulatory Phonetics
- stop
- fricative
- affricate
- voice (glottal gesture & vocal folds)

glottal stops
- not written in English, implied by phonology of words
- glottal fricative: [h]
- not possible to voice glottal stops

vowels are normally voiced consonants may or may not be voiced

voiced sounds can be made loud or soft, or sung

Voice Onset Time
-if voicing coincides with the release of the consonant, consonant is voiceless
-_voiceless aspirated stops_
	- sometimes, voicing is delayed after the consonant is released, while vocal records are apart
	- shows up as friction on spectrogram

advanced voice onset 	/d/
coincident voice onset 	/t/ 		only occurs after fricatives
delayed voice onset 	/t^h/ 		doesn't occur after fricatives

nasal sound: velum is lowered

dissimilation: r-> get switched

Airstream Mechanisms
- glottalic sounds: air pressure builds up between glottis and articulator
	- egressive: ejectives; amerind, african, caucasian languages
	- ingressive: implosives; rare, found in some american, african, south asian language
- lingual sounds: air pressure from moving tongue
	- ingressive: clicks; only in khoisan languages of southern Africa and southern Bantu (Xhosa, Zulu)
- sibilants - special type of fricatives
	- high frequency
	- /s z ʃ ʒ/
- groove (sibilants) vs slit fricatives (th)
	- tongue shape

Secondary Articulations
- vocal tract is restricted articulations (co-articulations)
- labialization		kʷ
- palatalization	kʲ
- velarization		ɫ
- pharyngealization
- glottalization

---
Great Vowel Shift
- massive change in pronunciation of English long vowels, beginning in 1500s

parameters for vowels:
- part of tongue raised
- height of tongue
- position of palate (nasalization)
- lip position (round/spread)
- tenseness
- length (supersegmental)

-English front vowels are always unrounded, back vowels always rounded
- diphthongs are vowels plus glides
	- bit, beet 	[ɪ, i]
	- bet bait		[з, e]
	- pull, pool 	[ʊ, u]
	- 1st vowels are short and lax
	- 2nd vowels are long and tense, tending strongly towards dipthongization

Phonetic Features tend to be binary
- [ʊ] [+V, -C, +back, +high, +round, -tense]
- [n] [+C, +stop, +apical, +voice, +nasal]

typical languages have more than twice as many consonants as vowels

| language | consonants | vowels |
| -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Haida (Amerind) | 46 | 3 |
| Powaian (Indo-Pacific) | 12 | 10 |
| English | 24 | 11-13 |

Universal Implications
- in general, languages have more 'marked' (unusual) sounds only if they have more 'unmarked' (usual) sounds
	- p -> k
	- k -> t except Hawaiian
	- g -> d
	- d -> b
	- m -> n
- relationships mirrored in frequency of sounds in languages
	- /n t d s/
	- /sh ts zh/
	- [ʃ tʃ dʒ ʒ]. 
- nasal iff oral stops
- voiced iff voiceless stops
- front rounded vowels iff back rounded vowels
- relative ease of pronunciation
- vowel systems tend to be symmetrical
	- probably because easier to differentiate

English vowels
- some vowels are being replaced by related vowels

Supersegmental/Prosodic Features
- stress - loudness relative to neighboring sounds (variation in amplitude of sound waves)
- pitch - different in frequency relative to neighboring sounds, due to increased tension of vocal bands and higher air pressure
- length - longer periods of *
- accent - includes stress, pitch, and length in combinations that vary from language to language
	- English stress accent language
	- accent placement can affect meaning of word
- tone
	- tonal languages have different meaning
	- English signals illocutionary type (statement, question, etc)
- span over syllables or phrases

Resonance

| Obstruants | vs | Sonorants |
| --------- | -- | ---------- |
| stops | | glides/semivowels |
| fricatives | | liquids |
| | | nasals |

- sonorant produced with continuous, non-turbulent airflow

# Phonology
English past tense

| verb ending | past tense ending|
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| alveolar stop (t/d) | -ed |
| voiced | -d |
| voiceless | -t |

1. **allomorphy**: - different forms of morphemes, called _allomorphs_, have predictable distribution based on phonetics of neighboring sounds
2. **natural classes**: don't have to list the sounds that trigger an allomorph one by one; identify by specifying one feature in common
- [+v] = [a l o j rr b n g z zh v ...]
- [+stop] = [p b g k n m t d ...]
- [+alveolar] = [s z t d ts ...]
- [+sibilant] = [s z zh ts dzh tsh ...] (high freq fricatives/affricates)
- [-D past] /eed/ /t/ /d/
3. **Assimilation** - sounds tend to become more like the sounds around them
- consonants become voiced when adjacent to voiced sounds & vice versa
- \[CF]:[+v]->[+v]\_[+v]
- **dissimilations**: sounds that sound too similar change to be different
- flood/flooded
- cats, dogs, buses [+v$]->[s], [-v$]->[z] [sibilant]->[ez]
4. Mental grammars allows us to perceive sounds that aren't there
- bad at identifying speech sounds in isolation without linguistic context
- in context, we can recognize words before they are finished
	- knowledge of grammar enables us to guess what comes next
- people speak ~150-200 words per minute

## Allophones
- [t^h] [t] [D] [?] are _allophones_ of the same _phoneme_
- [d] [t] are different phonemes
	- 'done' & 'ton' differ in meaning and exactly one sound -> **minimal pair**

| | contrastive sounds | allophonic sounds | free variation |
| - | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| relation to phonemes | allophones of separate phonemes | allophones of same phoneme | allophones of same phoneme |
| distribution predictability | unpredictable | predictable | unpredictable |
| how to recognize | - contrastive distribution <br> - minimal pairs <br> - overlapping distribution with differences in meaning | complementary distribution | overlapping distribution with no difference in meaning

## Figuring out the sound system of a new language
1. identify different sounds that occur in the language
	- determine **phoneme inventory**
2. determine which differences are distinctive and meaningful (phonemic)
	- find _minimal pairs_
3. which differences are automatic, predictable, meaningless (allophonic)
	- identify phonetic environments in which allophones occur
	- 4 contexts:
		- surrounding (preceding/following) phones in
		- syllable phone is in
		- surrounding syllables
		- stress of syllables (suprasegmental features)

- must be done individually for each language
- phonemic differences in one language don't apply to all languages
- allophonic distribution for 2 allophones usually 1 allophone restricted to certain context, and other allophone is everywhere else

example:
/s/ in front of back vowel
/sh/ in front of non back vowel

zulu
/ou/+C+low vowel
/o/+C+tense vowel

korean
/r/ in between vowels
/l/ elsewhere

## Paradigmatic vs Syntagmatic linguistic description
- _paradigmatic_: which parts is the language made of 
	- in phonology ...
- _syntagmatic_: how the parts combine together
	- in phonology, how sounds combine with each other in sequences: phonotactics

## Word Clusters
Old English initial clusters only allow:
- 1st consonant obstruants: stops, fricatives
- 2nd consonant sonorants: glides, liquids, nasals, semivowels

Modern English Initial Consonant Clusters:
- bn, gn, kn, fn no longer allowed
- bl, br, gl, gr, kl, kr, fl, fr still allowed
- 1st consonant obstruants: stops, fricatives
- 2nd consonant liquids (or non-nasal sonorants)

- exceptions:
- first consonant is /s/ (obstruant followed by anything)
- loan words from other languages, e.g. from Greek, which have different set of restrictions

Other restrictions
- Greek has 2nd obstruant is alveolar
- English 3-consonant cluster: /s/+Stop+Liquid
- Japanese has no consonant clusters: insert vowels

possible word-initial sequences:

| | JP | EN | Old EN | GK |
| - | -- | -- | ------ | -- |
| CV | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| OL | N | Y | Y | Y |
| ON | N | N | Y | Y |
| OO | N | N | N | Y |
| SS | N | N | N | N |

- possible implicational universal?
	- if language has ON onset cluster, must also have OL onset clusters
	- no counterexample yet

Homorganic Cluster Constraint
- obstruent+sonorant initial consonant cluster not allowed if both are in same place of articulation (Greek)

Final Word Clusters
- end with /nt/ but not begin with /nt/
- begin with /pl/ but not end with /lp/
- rules only apply to consonant cluster

# Syllables and Feet
- /tl/ /pl/ /lp/ /kn/ allowed in middle of word
- not allowed at beginning or end of _syllable_
- syllable boundary between consonants, no longer a consonant cluster

- intuition tells us how to break words up into their syllables and how many there are

## Syllable Anatomy

![Syllable Anatomy](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/1101/syllable.png)

- onset
- nucleus (relative peak of sonority)
- coda

## Sonority & Sonority Scale
- some consonants are more sonorous (vowel-like) than others
- obstruents < sonorants
- nasal stops < liquids
- voiceless < voiced stops
- obstruents, nasals, liquids, vowels

- sonority contour of syllables: need a maximally sonorous center
- slope of rise has different threshold, depending on language, can change over time
- if increase/decrease in sonority isn't strong enough for language, consonant cluster cannot begin the syllable
- languages prefer syllables to initially increase sonority, reach peak in middle
	- languages differ in how steep sonority rise, CV-CCCV
	- Eng: Obs-Liq-Vow
- consonant sequences vs consonant clusters (must be in same syllable)

### **Homorganic Cluster Constraint**: Eng: pl, \*tl, kl; Gk: pn, \*pm
- syllable structure: onset,rhyme:nucleus,coda
	- onsets can be moved (pig latin, spoonerisms)
	- heavy syllable: branching rhyme: closed syllable (end in consonant) or branching nucleus (long vowel or diphthong)

- determining difference between onsets and codas: maximize the onset of next syllable

### Ambisyllabicity
English lax vowels only occur in **closed syllable** - syllable with coda

---
## Feet
- infixed expletives can only be inserted between some syllables - after feet
- feet: full syllables vs reduced syllables, impacts stress assignment
- stress the strongest syllable
- /t/ and /d/ flapped when between vowels and when both members of same foot
- syllables with reduced vowels are **reduced syllables**, cannot form foot on their own
- reduced syllables attached to right of full syllable to form full foot
---

# Morphology
- morpheme - minimal chunk of sound associated with fixed meaning
- allomorphy, usually caused by assimilation
	- inter/relat/tion/ship/s
- 3 ways to classify

### Free vs Bound Morphemes
- free morpheme - morpheme can be a word by itself
- bound morphemes are _affixes_, stuck onto free morphemes
	- classified by where they attach to free morpheme
	- prefix, suffix, infix
- _reduplication_ special case of affixation; affix created by copying part of root
	- replacives: man/men, mouse/mice, find/found, eat/ate
	- suppletion: extreme replacive morphology, completely replace word: go/went, am/was, good/better

### Productivity of Morphemes
- _open class morphemes_:
	house, wi-fi, tweet, run
- _closed class morphemes_:
	- conjunctions, pronouns, prepositions, etc
	- and, but, if, I, to, the, then, must

### Function of Morphemes
- _inflectional morphemes_: create grammatical forms of single lexeme (e.g. past tense, plural)
	- cat/cats, run/runs/ran/running
- _derivational morphemes_: form new rods (lexemes) from other words
	- govern/misgovern, tie/untie, govern/government/governable
	- tends to be nonproductive

### Compounding
- special form of derivational morphology, combining 2+ free (root) morphemes
- generally PoS determined by last word
	- exception e.g. passer-by noun not adv/prep, not productive, allows inflectional morphemes in middle, has stress contour of phrase
- type of derivational morphology -> inflectional morphology occurs afterwards
- noncompositional meaning:
	- blue bird/bluebird, red coat/Redcoat, green house/greenhouse
- have stress and intonation patterns as if single word, as opposed to phrases
**cranberry morpheme** - root morpheme but not free

### Inflectional Morphology
few productive affixes left in English
- 's(genitive) -> behaves more like clitic (attach to end of phrases)
- -ed (past participle), -ed(past tense) -ing(pres tense), -s(pres tense), -en(perf tense), -er(comparative), -est(superlative), -s (npl)

### Words as morphological trees
- un- (do the opposite of verb)
- un- (describe opposite adjective)
- ambiguity from multiple possible derivations: 
	- untieable: _(untie)able_ capable of being untied vs _un(tieable)_ incapable of being tied
- inflectional morphology always last

|  [re[construct]]tion | un[[afford]able] | [[man]li]ness | im[[person]al] |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| inter[[nation]al] | [mis[understand]]ing | [ir[replace]]ability | [un[happi]]er |

## Types of suffixes
### Class I suffixes
\-ity -ous -ory -al -ify -ive -ize -ion, -ian
- cause sound changes to roots, including accent shift
- mostly come from Latin or through Romance language

### Class II suffixes
\-less -ish -er -ness -ful
- don't cause sound changes to roots
- native suffixes
- productive

- can attach Class II suffixes to words that already have suffixes, but not Class I

# Syntax
_lexical ambiguity_ arises when two word sound alike (homophony)
- smallest units with meanings must be smaller than words
- antecedent don't have to precede pronoun; they can co-refer

- syntax - structural organization of language above the level of the word
- morphology - structural organization of word below the level of the word

- semantic criteria doesn't provide sound basis for classifying words into distinct morphological/syntactic categories
	- noun - "person, place or thing"
		- murder is an action, illness is a state
	- "The river stretches over \_ and \_"
		- stretches is a state, not an action
	- fast food
		- fast is an adverb describing action of creating food, not the food itself
	- some nouns use singular form to refer to quantities (air, water) "mass nouns"

### **phonesthemes**
- a sound that tends to show up in words that have similar meaning
- e.g. glow, glimmer, glitter
- used to be a morpheme in English ancestor: "ghel-" - to shine
- _frequentive morpheme _
	- "-er", "-le" - t do x repeatedly
	- gleam+er = glimmer, float+er = flutter, waddle, dribble
- _sound symbolism_
	- "small" words tend to have front vowels

- syntax hierarchical organization needed to account for ambiguity of word order
- word categories (noun, verb, adjective, preposition)

- _topic fronting_ - take noun phrase and put in beginning of sentence
- can only move complete phrases, not just strings of words

- nouns are contained in noun phrases
- principle of projection

### Phrase Constituents
- constituents: phrase elements
	- smaller phrases, build clauses, build sentences

- identify phrases: they can behave as a single unit
	- can substitute them with something else (e.g. pronouns)
	- intervention test/separability: can't insert elements in the middle
	- movement test, clefts/topic-fronting
	- meaning: deletion test/sentence fragment tests

- finding complete phrases:
	- questions
	- clefting (incl topic fronting)/movement
	- substitution
	- separability: syntactic trees can't cross

- if word can replace phrase, it is also a phrase/if can't replace a phrase, not a phrase
- proverb - can substitute verb phrase

- negated phrase
- "not" can become part of verb phrase or merely precede it

- _merge_ components to build sentence tree
	- driven by semantics
	- things that semantically belong together likely in the same phrase in syntax

### Arguments vs. Adjuncts
- arguments required by other phrases
- adjuncts optional phrases
	- adjuncts attached at higher level in syntactic tree - less related to meaning
	- arguments tend to be objects
	- adjectives - adjuncts
- recursive phrasing -> no maximal length

### Sentence Heads
- auxiliary verb believed to be the head of the sentence (inflection)
- verb phrase is complement to auxiliary verb to form inflection'
- combine inflection with noun phrase complement to form inflection phrase = sentence

- every phrase must have head
- noun phrase - noun; verb phrase - verb
- no auxiliary verb, but head (inflection) is there

### Assumptions
1. Phrases have unique heads, determining their category and grammatical properties
2. words project phrases (N -> NP)
3. phrase structure trees are binary branching
4. most phrases are endocentric, not exocentric (have heads)
- inflection phrases/auxiliary verbs
- forms of "to be" can't follow negation, put in auxiliary position

### Modals
in auxiliary position
- modal -> have -> be -> do (semantically meaningless, but gives tense)
- **transformation** movement operation -> _transformational grammar_
- tense, number marker, 'do-support', move to front for question
	- questions have a head
	- complementizers precede subject
- complementizers are heads, similarly replaced by other auxiliary verbs
- not on prelim

# Semantics
- study of meanng of linguistic expressions
- meaning expressed by linguistic utterance by virtue of its form alone
- _semiotics_/_semiology_ - general study of signs, in technical sense of something having meaning
	- Ferdinand de Saussure, Charles Sanders Peirce
	- every sign is pairing of shape (_signans_) and meaning (_signatum_)
- index: sign has characteristics associated in nature with its meaning (m/f)
- symbols: conventional characteristics (radiation, stop)
- iconic: includes onomatopoeia
<br><br>
- iconicity & indexing partially arbitrary

## Theories of Meaning
- know shortcomings of each theory
1. Meaning as Reference
- extensional definition of word: things it refers to (_referents_)
	- _tautology_
2. Meaning as Reference in Some Possible World
3. Meaning as Mental Image
- intensional meaning: meaning of word in its inherent sense; refers to mental image of the world
4. Meaning as Use
- **Use Theory of Meaning** (Ludwig Wittgenstein): determined by its use in language community 
	- relation to other linguistic expressions
	- not entity-oriented
	- having meaning means words are used in a particular sense
<br><br>
- dichotomies
	- sense and reference
	- intension and extension
	- connotation and denotation

## Word Relationships
- native speakers make judgments about meaning relationships
- can play with _ambiguity_
	- lexical ambiguity: he dusted the plants
	- scope (structural) ambiguity: good cigars and whiskey
	- zeugma
- _entailment_: A entails B if when A is true, B is true and information B conveys is also contained in information A conveys
	- John killed Bill - Bill died
	- Jumbo is an elephant - Jumbo is mammal
- _contradiction_: negation of entailment
	- if every X's Y is true, no X's Y is not true
	- can occur with conflicting entailments
- _redundancy_: entailed proposition is explicitly uttered
- _equivalence_/_synonymy_: bilateral statement
	- X is on Y/Y is under X
- _anomaly_: utterance contains contradictory entailments
	- Colorless green ideas sleep furiously
<br><br>
- words
- _synonymy_: synonyms - words that have the same meaning
- _antonymy_: antonyms - words that have opposite/reverse/converse meaning
	- gradeable/scalar adjectives differ by degrees
- _hyponymy_: relation of element to containing category
	- transitive relation

| hypernym | hyponym |
| - | - |
| flower | daffodil |
| color | red |

- _metonymy_: external relation between expressions
	- thing or concept referred to by name of something closely related
	- comments from the floor
- _synecdoche_: internal relation
	- part of a whole
	- "strings", a pint
- meronym - part of whole
- holonym - wholes to which meronyms belong

| meronym | holonym |
| - | - |
| nose | face |

## Semantic Natural Classes
- [animate] - anything alive
- every feature not specified for every word
	- redundancy rules (e.g. sonorant -> also voiced)

- semantic features/lexical decomposition
	- relations between words suggests they contain 'atoms' of meaning, which can be compared
	- creates semantic natural classes, parallel to phonological natural classes
	- used in entailment
- _intersective adjectives_: overlapping set of description
	- e.g. old
- _nonintersective_: not overlapping sets of descriptions
	- e.g. fake, small, heavy, good
	- _anti-intersective adjectives_: indicates complement of set being described
	- e.g. fake, counterfeit
- _subsective adjectives_
	- relative to category
	- e.g. loud whisper, big virus

#### Definite & Indefinite Articles
(borderline pragmatics)
- definiteness vs specificity
	- specificity: speaker has particular referent of expression in mind
	- definite: speaker can expect hearer to understand which reference speaker is thinking of
	- plural of indefinite pronoun is "unpronounced"

| | indefinite | definite |
| - | - | - |
| non-specific| He wants to buy a car | -- |
| specific | I don't think you have enough information to identify it | The moon set early last night |

#### Subject vs Predicate
- sentence can be divided into subject (entity), and preidcate (aserts some property is true of subject)
- forms proposition together -> have truth values
	- true when subject has property specified by predicate

#### Proposition
- proposition presupposes existence of its arguments
- presuppositions must be true for proposition to have meaning
- if proposition doesn't hold true, sentence is neither true nor false

#### Meaning is Composition of Parts
##### Quantifiers
- how many values of variable associated with subject to evaluate
- universal ∀
	- "the": only one member (exhaustiveness)
		- only one element in the set
	- predicates that describe permanent state or property -> most or typical example of behavior
- existential Ǝ
	- "a": Ǝx | cat(x) & in garden(x)
	- predicates that describe temporary state or property
	- \* at least one or exactly one
- quantifiers can have scope over each other
- different kinds of groups
	- bare plurals not synonymous with "all", but can be exploited and interpreted as such

##### Enumerability
- count nouns vs mass nouns
- mass noun plurals interpreted as groups/types

##### Affected vs Effected
- he painted the tree.

##### Deixis
- expressions whose reference depends on circumstances of utterance
	- orientation of speaker and hearer
	- personal pointers, I/me/my/you/we/they etc
	- spacial pointers, here/there
	- temporal pointers, yesterday/now
