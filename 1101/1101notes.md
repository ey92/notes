# Intro
**language** is a system of rules mapping sounds/gestures and meanings
- mostly compositional
- idioms noncompositional

**grammar**
- descriptive grammar (observations)
- prescriptive grammar (guidelines how to construct phrases)
- mental grammar: set of rules for how to build words and sentences

fluency: lexicon + mental grammar

**morpheme**: "minimal strings of sounds associated with fixed meanings"
- may be words, but they may be smaller than words
-connection between sounds of a word and its meaning is mostly arbitrary
except
	* onomatopoeia
	* sound symbolism

sound instead of writing: humans have had language from the beginning 50,000yrs
- only literate about 5,000yrs
- infrequency of developing independent writing systems
- -> writing not central to language
- graphical way of representing sounds

representing sounds in writing
- no 'th' letter - multiple sounds for 'th'
- many letters have multiple sounds
- why use 2+ letters to represent sound?

**International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)**
- 1888
- phonetic alphabet with characters having simple, consistent sounds, based on the Roman alphabet
- one sound per character
- one character for every sound used distinctively in some language
- advantage of universality

**acoustic phonetics**: analysis of speech sounds in their physical aspect
_spectrograms_ produce graphs(_spectographs_) which map the _frequency_ (pulse/second) and intensity (_amplitude_) of vibrations over time


# Phonetics
## Phonetics 28/1
### Design features of language
- open-ended due to compositionality
- rule-governed
- mental grammars are generative
- rule-governed creativity -> understand new sentences; potentially infinite set of linguistic objects
- at each level, you can look at the objects that make up language from two different perspectives
	* **paradigmatic relationships** - what the chunks are, what categories they belong to
	* **syntagmatic relationships** - how they are put together (order, which ones work together)
- rules of grammar create 2D objects
	* language has linear order
	* but also hierarchical structure
- at level of sounds
	* phonetic features -> sound segments -> segments -> syllables, feet
	* **morphemes**: strings of sounds associated with fixed meanings, combine to form words usually ordered one after another
	* **free morphemes** - can stand by themselves as words
	* **bound morphemes** - can only occur in combination
- **word** - a free morpheme with all the bound morphemes attached to it
	*can a word be only made from bound morphemes?
- words -> phrases -> sentences

languages are learnable

---
**articulatory phonetics** - looks at the way sounds are formed in the human vocal tract
- "high-front vowel /i:/" vs "high-back vowel /u:/" vs "low vowel /a:/"
- physical position in mouth

**acoustic phonetics** - concerned with physical analysis of the speech sound
- _sound spectrogram_ (waveform) time x frequency
- _formant_ - uniform band of relatively great intensity in the sound spectrum over a particular frequency range

**perceptual phonetics** - concerned with the mechanisms of speech perception in the ear and the brain
- physical disturbances of air vibrating ear

separate from grammar: describes the physical/physiological phenomena outside the speaker's mind


### Consonants & Vowels
**consonants** involve some degree of obstruction of airflow
- **stop consonants** completely cut off airflow (hear consonant when air is released): t,g,b,p,m
	* on spectrogram: blank/d
- **fricative consonants** restrict airflow enough to create turbulence: f,v,th
**vowels** do not obstruct airflow but more concerned about the shape of the mouth

_semivowels_ /j/ /w/ phonetically (articulatorily and acoustically) vowels /ɪ/ /ʊ/

Classifying Sounds
- egressive pulmonary sounds - begin with airflow from lungs
	* airflow passes through the larynx and ca be modified by vocal cords in larynx

larynx is dangerously close to esophagus opening
- protected by epiglottis
- gives more room to articulate more sounds

voicing
- **vocal bands** - two muscular folds inside larynx which vibrate with each other when close together
- **voiced sounds** - sounds articulated with vocal cords
- **whispering**: holding back part of vocal cords apart
- **glottal stops** - created by momentarily closing the vocal cords

#### Articulatory Phonetics
- stop
- fricative
- affricate
- voice (glottal gesture & vocal folds)

glottal stops
- not written in English, implied by phonology of words
- glottal fricative: [h]
- not possible to voice glottal stops

vowels are normally voiced consonants may or may not be voiced

voiced sounds can be made loud or soft, or sung

Voice Onset Time
-if voicing coincides with the release of the consonant, consonant is voiceless
-_voiceless aspirated stops_
	- sometimes, voicing is delayed after the consonant is released, while vocal records are apart
	- shows up as friction on spectrogram

advanced voice onset 	/d/
coincident voice onset 	/t/ 		only occurs after fricatives
delayed voice onset 	/t^h/ 		doesn't occur after fricatives

nasal sound: velum is lowered

dissimilation: r-> get switched

Airstream Mechanisms
- glottalic sounds: air pressure builds up between glottis and articulator
	- egressive: ejectives; amerind, african, caucasian languages
	- ingressive: implosives; rare, found in some american, african, south asian language
- lingual sounds: air pressure from moving tongue
	- ingressive: clicks; only in khoisan languages of southern Africa and southern Bantu (Xhosa, Zulu)
- sibilants - special type of fricatives
	- high frequency
	- /s z ʃ ʒ/
- groove (sibilants) vs slit fricatives (th)
	- tongue shape

Secondary Articulations
- vocal tract is restricted articulations (co-articulations)
- labialization		kʷ
- palatalization	kʲ
- velarization		ɫ
- pharyngealization
- glottalization

---
Great Vowel Shift
- massive change in pronunciation of English long vowels, beginning in 1500s

parameters for vowels:
- part of tongue raised
- height of tongue
- position of palate (nasalization)
- lip position (round/spread)
- tenseness
- length (supersegmental)

-English front vowels are always unrounded, back vowels always rounded
- diphthongs are vowels plus glides
	- bit, beet 	[ɪ, i]
	- bet bait		[з, e]
	- pull, pool 	[ʊ, u]
	- 1st vowels are short and lax
	- 2nd vowels are long and tense, tending strongly towards dipthongization

Phonetic Features tend to be binary
- [ʊ] [+V, -C, +back, +high, +round, -tense]
- [n] [+C, +stop, +apical, +voice, +nasal]

typical languages have more than twice as many consonants as vowels

| language | consonants | vowels |
| -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Haida (Amerind) | 46 | 3 |
| Powaian (Indo-Pacific) | 12 | 10 |
| English | 24 | 11-13 |

Universal Implications
- in general, languages have more 'marked' (unusual) sounds only if they have more 'unmarked' (usual) sounds
	- p -> k
	- k -> t except Hawaiian
	- g -> d
	- d -> b
	- m -> n
- relationships mirrored in frequency of sounds in languages
	- /n t d s/
	- /sh ts zh/
	- [ʃ tʃ dʒ ʒ]. 
- nasal iff oral stops
- voiced iff voiceless stops
- front rounded vowels iff back rounded vowels
- relative ease of pronunciation
- vowel systems tend to be symmetrical
	- probably because easier to differentiate

English vowels
- some vowels are being replaced by related vowels

Supersegmental/Prosodic Features
- stress - loudness relative to neighboring sounds (variation in amplitude of sound waves)
- pitch - different in frequency relative to neighboring sounds, due to increased tension of vocal bands and higher air pressure
- length - longer periods of *
- accent - includes stress, pitch, and length in combinations that vary from language to language
	- English stress accent language
	- accent placement can affect meaning of word
- tone
	- tonal languages have different meaning
	- English signals illocutionary type (statement, question, etc)
- span over syllables or phrases

Resonance

| Obstruants | vs | Sonorants |
| --------- | -- | ---------- |
| stops | | glides/semivowels |
| fricatives | | liquids |
| | | nasals |

- sonorant produced with continuous, non-turbulent airflow

# Phonology
English past tense

| verb ending | past tense ending|
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| alveolar stop (t/d) | -ed |
| voiced | -d |
| voiceless | -t |

1. **allomorphy**: - different forms of morphemes, called _allomorphs_, have predictable distribution based on phonetics of neighboring sounds
2. **natural classes**: don't have to list the sounds that trigger an allomorph one by one; identify by specifying one feature in common
- [+v] = [a l o j rr b n g z zh v ...]
- [+stop] = [p b g k n m t d ...]
- [+alveolar] = [s z t d ts ...]
- [+sibilant] = [s z zh ts dzh tsh ...] (high freq fricatives/affricates)
- [-D past] /eed/ /t/ /d/
3. **Assimilation** - sounds tend to become more like the sounds around them
- consonants become voiced when adjacent to voiced sounds & vice versa
- \[CF]:[+v]->[+v]\_[+v]
- **dissimilations**: sounds that sound too similar change to be different
- flood/flooded
- cats, dogs, buses [+v$]->[s], [-v$]->[z] [sibilant]->[ez]
4. Mental grammars allows us to perceive sounds that aren't there
- bad at identifying speech sounds in isolation without linguistic context
- in context, we can recognize words before they are finished
	- knowledge of grammar enables us to guess what comes next
- people speak ~150-200 words per minute

## Allophones
- [t^h] [t] [D] [?] are _allophones_ of the same _phoneme_
- [d] [t] are different phonemes
	- 'done' & 'ton' differ in meaning and exactly one sound -> **minimal pair**

| | contrastive sounds | allophonic sounds | free variation |
| - | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| relation to phonemes | allophones of separate phonemes | allophones of same phoneme | allophones of same phoneme |
| distribution predictability | unpredictable | predictable | unpredictable |
| how to recognize | - contrastive distribution <br> - minimal pairs <br> - overlapping distribution with differences in meaning | complementary distribution | overlapping distribution with no difference in meaning

## Figuring out the sound system of a new language
1. identify different sounds that occur in the language
	- determine **phoneme inventory**
2. determine which differences are distinctive and meaningful (phonemic)
	- find _minimal pairs_
3. which differences are automatic, predictable, meaningless (allophonic)
	- identify phonetic environments in which allophones occur
	- 4 contexts:
		- surrounding (preceding/following) phones in
		- syllable phone is in
		- surrounding syllables
		- stress of syllables (suprasegmental features)

- must be done individually for each language
- phonemic differences in one language don't apply to all languages
- allophonic distribution for 2 allophones usually 1 allophone restricted to certain context, and other allophone is everywhere else

example:
/s/ in front of back vowel
/sh/ in front of non back vowel

zulu
/ou/+C+low vowel
/o/+C+tense vowel

korean
/r/ in between vowels
/l/ elsewhere

## Paradigmatic vs Syntagmatic linguistic description
- _paradigmatic_: which parts is the language made of 
	- in phonology ...
- _syntagmatic_: how the parts combine together
	- in phonology, how sounds combine with each other in sequences: phonotactics

## Word Clusters
Old English initial clusters only allow:
- 1st consonant obstruants: stops, fricatives
- 2nd consonant sonorants: glides, liquids, nasals, semivowels

Modern English Initial Consonant Clusters:
- bn, gn, kn, fn no longer allowed
- bl, br, gl, gr, kl, kr, fl, fr still allowed
- 1st consonant obstruants: stops, fricatives
- 2nd consonant liquids (or non-nasal sonorants)

- exceptions:
- first consonant is /s/ (obstruant followed by anything)
- loan words from other languages, e.g. from Greek, which have different set of restrictions

Other restrictions
- Greek has 2nd obstruant is alveolar
- English 3-consonant cluster: /s/+Stop+Liquid
- Japanese has no consonant clusters: insert vowels

possible word-initial sequences:

| | JP | EN | Old EN | GK |
| - | -- | -- | ------ | -- |
| CV | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| OL | N | Y | Y | Y |
| ON | N | N | Y | Y |
| OO | N | N | N | Y |
| SS | N | N | N | N |

- possible implicational universal?
	- if language has ON onset cluster, must also have OL onset clusters
	- no counterexample yet

Homorganic Cluster Constraint
- obstruent+sonorant initial consonant cluster not allowed if both are in same place of articulation (Greek)

Final Word Clusters
- end with /nt/ but not begin with /nt/
- begin with /pl/ but not end with /lp/
- rules only apply to consonant cluster

# Syllables and Feet
- /tl/ /pl/ /lp/ /kn/ allowed in middle of word
- not allowed at beginning or end of _syllable_
- syllable boundary between consonants, no longer a consonant cluster

- intuition tells us how to break words up into their syllables and how many there are

## Syllable Anatomy

![Syllable Anatomy](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/1101/syllable.png)

- onset
- nucleus (relative peak of sonority)
- coda

## Sonority & Sonority Scale
- some consonants are more sonorous (vowel-like) than others
- obstruents < sonorants
- nasal stops < liquids
- voiceless < voiced stops
- obstruents, nasals, liquids, vowels

- sonority contour of syllables: need a maximally sonorous center
- slope of rise has different threshold, depending on language, can change over time
- if increase/decrease in sonority isn't strong enough for language, consonant cluster cannot begin the syllable
- languages prefer syllables to initially increase sonority, reach peak in middle
	- languages differ in how steep sonority rise, CV-CCCV
	- Eng: Obs-Liq-Vow
- consonant sequences vs consonant clusters (must be in same syllable)

### **Homorganic Cluster Constraint**: Eng: pl, \*tl, kl; Gk: pn, \*pm
- syllable structure: onset,rhyme:nucleus,coda
	- onsets can be moved (pig latin, spoonerisms)
	- heavy syllable: branching rhyme: closed syllable (end in consonant) or branching nucleus (long vowel or diphthong)

- determining difference between onsets and codas: maximize the onset of next syllable

### Ambisyllabicity
English lax vowels only occur in **closed syllable** - syllable with coda

---
## Feet
- infixed expletives can only be inserted between some syllables - after feet
- feet: full syllables vs reduced syllables, impacts stress assignment
- stress the strongest syllable
- /t/ and /d/ flapped when between vowels and when both members of same foot
- syllables with reduced vowels are **reduced syllables**, cannot form foot on their own
- reduced syllables attached to right of full syllable to form full foot
---

# Morphology
- morpheme - minimal chunk of sound associated with fixed meaning
- allomorphy, usually caused by assimilation
	- inter/relat/tion/ship/s
- 3 ways to classify

### Free vs Bound Morphemes
- free morpheme - morpheme can be a word by itself
- bound morphemes are _affixes_, stuck onto free morphemes
	- classified by where they attach to free morpheme
	- prefix, suffix, infix
- _reduplication_ special case of affixation; affix created by copying part of root
	- replacives: man/men, mouse/mice, find/found, eat/ate
	- suppletion: extreme replacive morphology, completely replace word: go/went, am/was, good/better

### Productivity of Morphemes
- _open class morphemes_:
	house, wi-fi, tweet, run
- _closed class morphemes_:
	- conjunctions, pronouns, prepositions, etc
	- and, but, if, I, to, the, then, must

### Function of Morphemes
- _inflectional morphemes_: create grammatical forms of single lexeme (e.g. past tense, plural)
	- cat/cats, run/runs/ran/running
- _derivational morphemes_: form new rods (lexemes) from other words
	- govern/misgovern, tie/untie, govern/government/governable
	- tends to be nonproductive

### Compounding
- special form of derivational morphology, combining 2+ free (root) morphemes
- generally PoS determined by last word
	- exception e.g. passer-by noun not adv/prep, not productive, allows inflectional morphemes in middle, has stress contour of phrase
- type of derivational morphology -> inflectional morphology occurs afterwards
- noncompositional meaning:
	- blue bird/bluebird, red coat/Redcoat, green house/greenhouse
- have stress and intonation patterns as if single word, as opposed to phrases
**cranberry morpheme** - root morpheme but not free

### Inflectional Morphology
few productive affixes left in English
- 's(genitive) -> behaves more like clitic (attach to end of phrases)
- -ed (past participle), -ed(past tense) -ing(pres tense), -s(pres tense), -en(perf tense), -er(comparative), -est(superlative), -s (npl)

### Words as morphological trees
- un- (do the opposite of verb)
- un- (describe opposite adjective)
- ambiguity from multiple possible derivations: 
	- untieable: _(untie)able_ capable of being untied vs _un(tieable)_ incapable of being tied
- inflectional morphology always last

|  [re[construct]]tion | un[[afford]able] | [[man]li]ness | im[[person]al] |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| inter[[nation]al] | [mis[understand]]ing | [ir[replace]]ability | [un[happi]]er |

## Types of suffixes
### Class I suffixes
\-ity -ous -ory -al -ify -ive -ize -ion, -ian
- cause sound changes to roots, including accent shift
- mostly come from Latin or through Romance language

### Class II suffixes
\-less -ish -er -ness -ful
- don't cause sound changes to roots
- native suffixes
- productive

- can attach Class II suffixes to words that already have suffixes, but not Class I

# Syntax
_lexical ambiguity_ arises when two word sound alike (homophony)
- smallest units with meanings must be smaller than words
- antecedent don't have to precede pronoun; they can co-refer

- syntax - structural organization of language above the level of the word
- morphology - structural organization of word below the level of the word

- semantic criteria doesn't provide sound basis for classifying words into distinct morphological/syntactic categories
	- noun - "person, place or thing"
		- murder is an action, illness is a state
	- "The river stretches over \_ and \_"
		- stretches is a state, not an action
	- fast food
		- fast is an adverb describing action of creating food, not the food itself
	- some nouns use singular form to refer to quantities (air, water) "mass nouns"

### **phonesthemes**
- a sound that tends to show up in words that have similar meaning
- e.g. glow, glimmer, glitter
- used to be a morpheme in English ancestor: "ghel-" - to shine
- _frequentive morpheme_
	- "-er", "-le" - to do x repeatedly
	- gleam+er = glimmer, float+er = flutter, waddle, dribble
- _sound symbolism_
	- "small" words tend to have front vowels

- syntax hierarchical organization needed to account for ambiguity of word order
- word categories (noun, verb, adjective, preposition)

- _topic fronting_ - take noun phrase and put in beginning of sentence
- can only move complete phrases, not just strings of words

- nouns are contained in noun phrases
- principle of projection

### Phrase Constituents
- constituents: phrase elements
	- smaller phrases, build clauses, build sentences

- identify phrases: they can behave as a single unit
	- can substitute them with something else (e.g. pronouns)
	- intervention test/separability: can't insert elements in the middle
	- movement test, clefts/topic-fronting
	- meaning: deletion test/sentence fragment tests

- finding complete phrases:
	- questions
	- clefting (incl topic fronting)/movement
	- substitution
	- separability: syntactic trees can't cross

- if word can replace phrase, it is also a phrase/if can't replace a phrase, not a phrase
- proverb - can substitute verb phrase

- negated phrase
- "not" can become part of verb phrase or merely precede it

- _merge_ components to build sentence tree
	- driven by semantics
	- things that semantically belong together likely in the same phrase in syntax

### Arguments vs. Adjuncts
- arguments required by other phrases
- adjuncts optional phrases
	- adjuncts attached at higher level in syntactic tree - less related to meaning
	- arguments tend to be objects
	- adjectives - adjuncts
- recursive phrasing -> no maximal length

### Sentence Heads
- auxiliary verb believed to be the head of the sentence (inflection)
- verb phrase is complement to auxiliary verb to form inflection'
- combine inflection with noun phrase complement to form inflection phrase = sentence

- every phrase must have head
- noun phrase - noun; verb phrase - verb
- no auxiliary verb, but head (inflection) is there

### Assumptions
1. Phrases have unique heads, determining their category and grammatical properties
2. words project phrases (N -> NP)
3. phrase structure trees are binary branching
4. most phrases are endocentric, not exocentric (have heads)
- inflection phrases/auxiliary verbs
- forms of "to be" can't follow negation, put in auxiliary position

### Modals
in auxiliary position
- modal -> have -> be -> do (semantically meaningless, but gives tense)
- **transformation** movement operation -> _transformational grammar_
- tense, number marker, 'do-support', move to front for question
	- questions have a head
	- complementizers precede subject
- complementizers are heads, similarly replaced by other auxiliary verbs
- not on prelim

# Semantics
- study of meanng of linguistic expressions
- meaning expressed by linguistic utterance by virtue of its form alone
- _semiotics_/_semiology_ - general study of signs, in technical sense of something having meaning
	- Ferdinand de Saussure, Charles Sanders Peirce
	- every sign is pairing of shape (_signans_) and meaning (_signatum_)
- index: sign has characteristics associated in nature with its meaning (m/f)
- symbols: conventional characteristics (radiation, stop)
- iconic: includes onomatopoeia
<br><br>
- iconicity & indexing partially arbitrary

## Theories of Meaning
- know shortcomings of each theory
1. Meaning as Reference
- extensional definition of word: things it refers to (_referents_)
	- _tautology_
2. Meaning as Reference in Some Possible World
3. Meaning as Mental Image
- intensional meaning: meaning of word in its inherent sense; refers to mental image of the world
4. Meaning as Use
- **Use Theory of Meaning** (Ludwig Wittgenstein): determined by its use in language community 
	- relation to other linguistic expressions
	- not entity-oriented
	- having meaning means words are used in a particular sense
<br><br>
- dichotomies
	- sense and reference
	- intension and extension
	- connotation and denotation

## Word Relationships
- native speakers make judgments about meaning relationships
- can play with _ambiguity_
	- lexical ambiguity: he dusted the plants
	- scope (structural) ambiguity: good cigars and whiskey
	- zeugma
- _entailment_: A entails B if when A is true, B is true and information B conveys is also contained in information A conveys
	- John killed Bill - Bill died
	- Jumbo is an elephant - Jumbo is mammal
- _contradiction_: negation of entailment
	- if every X's Y is true, no X's Y is not true
	- can occur with conflicting entailments
- _redundancy_: entailed proposition is explicitly uttered
- _equivalence_/_synonymy_: bilateral statement
	- X is on Y/Y is under X
- _anomaly_: utterance contains contradictory entailments
	- Colorless green ideas sleep furiously
<br><br>
- words
- _synonymy_: synonyms - words that have the same meaning
- _antonymy_: antonyms - words that have opposite/reverse/converse meaning
	- gradeable/scalar adjectives differ by degrees
- _hyponymy_: relation of element to containing category
	- transitive relation

| hypernym | hyponym |
| - | - |
| flower | daffodil |
| color | red |

- _metonymy_: external relation between expressions
	- thing or concept referred to by name of something closely related
	- comments from the floor
- _synecdoche_: internal relation
	- part of a whole
	- "strings", a pint
- meronym - part of whole
- holonym - wholes to which meronyms belong

| meronym | holonym |
| - | - |
| nose | face |

## Semantic Natural Classes
- [animate] - anything alive
- every feature not specified for every word
	- redundancy rules (e.g. sonorant -> also voiced)

- semantic features/lexical decomposition
	- relations between words suggests they contain 'atoms' of meaning, which can be compared
	- creates semantic natural classes, parallel to phonological natural classes
	- used in entailment
- _intersective adjectives_: overlapping set of description
	- e.g. old
- _nonintersective_: not overlapping sets of descriptions
	- e.g. fake, small, heavy, good
	- _anti-intersective adjectives_: indicates complement of set being described
	- e.g. fake, counterfeit
- _subsective adjectives_
	- relative to category
	- e.g. loud whisper, big virus

#### 1. Definite & Indefinite Articles
(borderline pragmatics)
- definiteness vs specificity
	- specificity: speaker has particular referent of expression in mind
	- definite: speaker can expect hearer to understand which reference speaker is thinking of
	- plural of indefinite pronoun is "unpronounced"
- indefinites can be both specific and non-specific
- noun phrases can be definite and non-specific
	- when prediction
		- If knight(x) & pulls sword from stone(x) -> will be king(x)
	- generic
		- If rat(x) -> mammal(x)

| | indefinite | definite |
| - | - | - |
| non-specific| He wants to buy a car | The knight who pulls the sword from this stone will be king <br> The rat is a mammal |
| specific | I don't think you have enough information to identify it | The moon set early last night |

#### 2. Subject vs Predicate
- sentence can be divided into subject (entity), and predicate (asserts some property is true of subject)
- forms proposition together -> have truth values
	- true when subject has property specified by predicate
	- semantics is computing truth values

##### Proposition
- proposition presupposes existence of its arguments
- presuppositions must be true for proposition to have meaning
- if proposition doesn't hold true, sentence is neither true nor false

#### 3. Meaning is Composition of Parts
##### Quantifiers
- how many values of variable associated with subject to evaluate
- universal ∀
	- "the": only one member (exhaustiveness)
		- only one element in the set
	- predicates that describe permanent state or property -> most or typical example of behavior
- existential Ǝ
	- "a": Ǝx | cat(x) & in garden(x)
	- predicates that describe temporary state or property
	- \* at least one or exactly one
- quantifiers can have scope over each other
- different kinds of groups
	- bare plurals not synonymous with "all", but can be exploited and interpreted as such
-**scope**

##### Enumerability
- count nouns vs mass nouns
- mass noun plurals interpreted as groups/types

##### Affected vs Effected
- he painted the tree.

##### Deixis
- expressions whose reference depends on circumstances of utterance
	- orientation of speaker and hearer
	- personal pointers, I/me/my/you/we/they etc
	- spacial pointers, here/there
	- temporal pointers, yesterday/now

## Presupposition
- if A presupposes B, A suggests B is true and also the truth of B is uncontroversial

### Factive verbs
- presuppose the truth of their complements
- e.g. realize, regret, know (unlike claim, say)
- He believes the water is polluted (but it's not)
- He realizes the water is polluted (must be true)

## Presupposition vs Entailment
- presuppositions are invariant under negation
- entailments disappear under negation

#### Entailment
- "This is a yellow pen" entails "This is yellow"
- negation: "This is not a yellow pen" doesn't entail "This is yellow"
	- entailment is gone

#### Presupposition
- "The man who left was his father" presupposes "A man left"
- negation: "The man who left wasn't his father" still presupposes "A man left"

#### Both
- can't be canceled unless both are negated
- "Joan regrets getting her PhD"
- !"Joan regrets getting her PhD, but she didn't get it"
	- can't cancel entailed assumption that she got her PhD
- "Joan doesn't regret getting her PhD because in fact she didn't get it"
	- negate assertion -> entailment disappears, only have a presupposition

## Exceptions
- we often don't speak literally
- much of the time, utterances not intended to be interpreted literally
- somehow able to 
	- convey/receive messages that aren't part of the utterance's literal meaning
	- use sentences in what seems inappropriate context, and expect to be understood (e.g. question used as a request)
- due to our ability to make assumptions based on context

# Pragmatics
- study of how language is used in particular contexts, to convey meanings and intentions
- study of situational contributions to interpretations
- guess what conversation partners know and what is reasonable to expect them to know

## Conversation as a Contract
#### Quality Assumptions
- conversation partners not
	- deliberately being deceitful
	- habitually making irrelevant utterances
	- crazy
- give them benefit of the doubt
- search for interpretations that are consistent with implicit contract
- willingness to look beyond the literal that allows us to express things figuratively
- conversation partners as invested in success of the conversation as we are
<br>
- pragmatics necessary because
	1. not all linguistic utterances intended to convey meanings, narrowly construed
	2. if they are, we don't always convey in a literal fashion that can be mechanically extracted from message
	3. if we do, hearer needs to draw on sources other than message to identify intent behind meaning
- allow us to contextually disambiguate ambiguities

## Implicature
- inferred additional meaning not literally from the sentence's meaning

- utterances have **locutionary force** (meanings)
- utterances also have **illocutionary force** (intent of the speaker)
	- requests for information, promises, commands, etc...
- e.g. "Can you pass the salt?" command as question
- e.g. "It's hot in here" request to lower the thermostat
- most commands in polite society disguised as other illocutionary types/acts (statements, questions)
	- _assertives_: commit speaker to truth of expressed proposition
	- _directives_: case hearer to take action (request, command, advice)
	- _commissives_: commit speaker to future action (promise, oath)
	- _expressives_: express speaker's attitudes/emotions towards proposition (congratulations, excuses, thanks)
	- _declarations_: change reality in accord with proposition of declaration (baptism, pronouncing guilty, marriage)
- don't take them at face value because principles of inference allow us to understand intended meaning
- _implicature_ is part of meaning of sentence which goes beyond its truth values
- _conversational implicature_ are implicatures understood by apply maxims of conversation

## Conversational Principles
- conversations we participate in are governed by conversational maxims
- trust interlocuters to contribute meaning
- existence of implicit social contract that allows us to understand nonliteral meanings
- taken advantage of by advertisers
- governed by Grice's Conversational Maxims
- frees speakers from making purely literal utterances

### Grice's Conversational Maxims
1. Maxims of Quantity
- say as much as is required
- don't say more than is required
- e.g. "I speak three languages" interpreted to mean "exactly three"
	- implicature, not entailment
2. Maxims of Quality
- say what's true and what you have evidence for
- often broken for figurative speech
3. Maxim of Relevance
- make calculations about what's going on in co-locqutor's head
- don't ask for information you already have
- be relevant
4. Maxim of Manner
- be orderly (say things in the right order)
- be brief

## Speech acts
- saying something is a speech act
- governed by 3 principles:
1. _illocutionary force_: speaker's intention is interpreted pragmatically by hearer
	- assertion
	- imperative
	- interrogative
2. _conversational principles_: hearer's expectations of the speaker
3. _presuppositions_: assumptions both the speaker and the hearer have to make for the utterance to make sense
- **performative**: performing the speech act makes them true (declarations, promises, etc)

### Metaphor
- describing one thing in terms of something else
- much language is metaphorical
- facilitate understanding of the world
- cultural schemata
- _synesthesia_: mixing senses; get sensory input from one sense, but feel sensory output from other senses

#### Orientational Metaphors
- social hierarchies, mood, morality
- we tend to anthropomorphize the world and interpret it in terms of our bodies
- not universal

#### Structural Metaphors
- the metaphor we choose shapes how we think about object being described (Lakoff)
- if mind is a container, learning is the process of filling that container with knowledge
- metaphors highlight certain aspects of things we understand in terms of them as well as hide other aspects

# Historical Linguistics
- everything about a language changes: sounds, words, inflections, syntax, meanings
- English used to have declensions
	- disappeared around 12th century
1. Sound Change
2. Comparative Reconstruction
3. Changes in Vocabulary, Grammar, Meaning

## Sound Change
- most kinds of sound change tend to be regular and without exception over long time spans
- **comparative method**
	- run sound change in reverse by comparing remotely related languages, seeing how their sounds differ, and reversing these changes, layer by layer, until we arrive at what common ancestor sounded like and what its morphemes were
	- Proto-Indo-European
		- know more of PIE grammar than some living languages
- historical and comparative linguistics study same process from opposite ends
	- historical: how language changes over time
	- comparative: how to reverse change to find system before change happened

### Regularity Hypothesis
- with certain exceptions, sound change is regular
	- if a sound changes in one word in a phonetic environment X, it will change in all other words in the language in environment X, without exception
	- sound change is regular, in the sense that the conditions under which it occurs are always exhaustively specifiable in phonological terms
- words can be borrowed after sound change occurred, leaving words in language that had environment for sound change
- sound changes tend to apply to natural classes of sounds, rather than individual sounds (e.g. fricatives, long vowels, voiceless stops)
- most sound changes are conditioned: shape of a sound changes in only a particular environment
- 3 exceptions: dissimilation, metathesis, haplology

### Changes in Quality
- **assimilation**: changes to a sound which make it more like other sounds around it in some way
	- _place assimilation_:
		- _palatalization_: 
			- drink/drench (drank-jan)
		- _umlaut_: vowel/vowel assimilation:
			- blod/bleed (blod-jan)
	- _voicing assimilation_:
		- _intervocalic assimilation of fricatives in pre-English_
		- breath/breathe (bred-en), bath/bathe, heath/heathen
		- wolf/wolves (wolf-as), staff/staves, house/houses
	- assmiliation is main source for allomorphs

### Changes in Quantity
- **segment loss**
	- pre-Old English Compensatory Lengthening: n-loss before fricatives (makes vowel longer)
		- sanft/soft, Gans/goose, fünf/five
	- Middle English Open Syllable Lengthening: loss of final vowels
		- nama/name, bana/bane, baðian/bathe
	- Old ENglish Closed Syllable Shortening
		- /waiz/,/wisdom/
- **lengthening and shortening**
	- _trisyllabic shortening_
		- divine/divinity
	- Old English _closed syllable shortening_
		- cēpan/cēpte -> keep/kept
		- wīse/wīsdom -> wise/wisdom
	- Middle English _open syllable lengthening_
		- nama -> nāmə -> name
		- baðian -> bāðen -> bathe
- **unconditioned changes** (almost)
	- Old English /sk/ -> /ʃ/
		- in initial position, after vowels, unless preceding vowel is back vowel
		- fisks -> fish

### Shifts
- applies to whole family of sounds
- sound change that applies not just to a single sound, but to a whole system of related sounds
- why shifts happen:
	- perceptually based pressures toward maintaining symmetry (distance between sounds)
	- sound change as therapy
- **Grimm's Law** (proto-Germanic)
	- all stop consonants changed
	- _voiceless stops -> voiceless fricatives_
		- /p/ -> /f/, /t/ -> /θ/, /k/ -> /h, piscatorial/fish, tres/three, centum/hundred
	- _voiced stops -> voiceless stops_
		- /b/ -> /p/, /d/ -> /t/, /g/ -> /k/, decem/ten, fagus/book
		- (almost no words beginning with b, most English p-words borrowed from Romance languages)
	- _voiced aspirated stops -> voiced stops_
		- /bh/ -> /b/, /dh/ -> /d/, /gh/ -> /g/, frater/brother, foris/door, hort-/greedy
- **Great Vowel Shift** (early Modern English)
	- all _long vowels_ -> _raised or turned into diphthongs_
		- low vowel -> middle vowel
		- middle vowel -> high vowel
		- high vowel -> diphthong
		- bītan/bite, fēt/feet, hūs/house, stān/stone, gōs/goose

### Irregular Sound Changes
- don't follow regularity hypothesis
1. **dissimilation**: rr -> rl or lr
	- peregrinus -> pèlerin -> pilgrim
	- arbore -> arbol
2. **metathesis**: rearranging sounds or syllables (usually _adjacent_/_local metathesis_ - switching 2+ contiguous sounds)
	- miraculum -> milagro
	- parabola -> palabra
3. **haplology**: elimination of syllable when two identical or similar syllables occur consecutively
	- Engla-land -> England

## Reconstruction
- some sound changes more likely
	- /p/ -> /f/ more likely than /f/ -> /p/
	- /p/ -> 0 more likely than 0 -> /p/
	- voiceless consonants -> voiced consonants in intervocalic environments (assimilation)
- some sound changes equally likely
	- intervocalic voicing of voiceless fricative vs final devoicing of voiced fricative
		- Gothic final devoicing of voiced fricatives (look for patterns with envirnoments)
		- seθ ~ seð-ai (underlying ð); gulθ ~ gulθa (underlying θ)
	- n -> 0 or 0 -> n preceding fricative
		- German words correspond to English without n preceding fricative, so English dropped the n
- sister languages have same sound, must have been the same sound in the parent language
- differing corresponding sets
- rule of thumb - the different sister language is the one that changed
- result must be compatible with Regularity Hypothesis

### Comparative Reconstruction
- comparative method developed 19th century largely by reference to one language family
- proposal of PIE, Sir William Jones, 1st paper 30 yrs later
- first step is to decide that a group of languages are genetically related, by comparing them
	- sometimes relation is obvious (Germanic languages)
- systematic changes are important, not similar sounds
	- w (PIE) -> f (Scottish Gaelic), g (Welsh)
- most telling is shared irregularity
1. determine languages are genetically related
2. list of cognates in related languages
3. determine sound change

### Internal Reconstruction
- form a hypothesis from comparing related forms within same language
- was/were, wise/wisdom, bathe/bath

# Language Typology
## Changing Morphology
- lose inflectional morphemes
	- English lost grammatical gender, adjective agreement, case endings
	- early Middle English ~ 12th c
- can also add inflectional morphemes
	- strong verbs: past tense change by changing vowel (Indo-European)
	- weak verbs: past tense formed by appending -ed (newer, added by Germanic languages)
		- probably from Indo-European _dho_ ('did') (_univerbation_)
- analogical leveling: simplify paradigm of word
	- pick one consonant for word's entire paradigm
	- freeze, froze, frozen/freeze, frore, froren
	- was/were z/r alternation kept (most frequently used verbs tend to resist change)
	- paradigm change applies across common patterns
	- strong verbs tend to become weak verbs (Germanic)

## Languages of the World and how to classify
- fossil words - origin of word no longer relevant
	- folk etymology
- new words
- English borrows many words
	- easiest way influence other languages
	- sometimes we fail to recognize morpheme/word boundaries
- back formation
	- use word root morphemes as words again by removing inflectional affixes
- words can change meanings by way of connotations becoming denotations
- melioration - better in meaning
- pejoration - worse in meaning
- verbicide - bleaching
- opacification - disguised compounds
- languages can resemble each other
- features that all languages share, simply because they are human languages?
- typology vs universals
- no boundary between language and dialect
	- "a language is a dialect with an army"

## Linguistic Demographics
- estimate ~ 6000 languages
- popular languages
	- Mandarin ~854M, Spanish 329M, English 328M, Hindi/Urdu 182M+60M, Arabic
- median language has ~9k native speakers
	- many languages with smaller populations in USA, Australia

### Vanishing Language Crisis
- many speakers switching from their language to a more dominant language (e.g. English, Spanish)
	- accelerating rate
	- in Brazil 19th c, more than 1k languages, today < 200 languages
	- in Aus, 500 to 250 languages
	- Native American languages dying out
	- estimates: 50-90% spoken languages of the world will disappear by the end of the current century
- raises questions:
	- is loss of small languages important
	- how is multilingualism beneficial to society? how does it pose challenges/obstacles
	- should multilingualism be supported? should education be through native language or dominant language
	- can/should language shift from minority to majority languages be stopped or reversed?
- many disappearing languages are understudied/lack documentation

## Language Universals
- things every language has
- vowels and consonants (except sign language)
- lexical categories (NVA)
	- Hausa lacks adjectives
	- Tongan makes no distinction
	- SE Asian lexical items pre-categorical, usable in any category
- recursion: embedding phrases
		- Piraha no recursion? embedding limited to one level
- **statistical universals**: most languages have X
	- e.g. word order SOV, SVO, VSO
- **implicational universals**: if a language has X, then it has Y
	- if it has voiced stops, it has voiceless stops
- methodological problems
	- e.g. word order
	- German SVO -> SOV in subordinate clauses
	- OSV seems to be missing among human languages
	- most of the world's languages show S precedes O

### Word Order Correlations
Greenberg found:

| word order | pp | AN | NG | rcl |
| ---------- | -- | -- | -- | --- |
| VSO | preposition | N adj | N Gen | N rcl |
| SVO | preposition | N adj | N Gen | N rcl |
| SOV | postposition | adj N | Gen N | rcl N |

- English is typologically inconsistent
	- VO: (PP head is P, AdjN head is N)

- 2 ways to account for variation in order:

#### 1. parameter fixing: head-first/head-final
- child generalizes observation to hypotheses about head positioning
- typologically inconsistent languages: child has to add corrective hypothesis
- adjective order?
	- big green cup vs green big cup

# Language Acquisition
- questions:
	- how early does language acquisition start?
	- how much is "prewired" in the brain
	- is language acquisition fundamentally different from other kinds of learning
	- are there universal milestones in language acquisition; what accounts for them
	- are children born with feature detectors?
		- mother's voice: left-hemisphere (language processing, motor skills); other woman's voice: right-hemisphere (voice recognition)
		- as young as 3 months, can predict what language they will speak -> phonology is in place as early as 3 months
- wug
	- wug test
- 2 hypothesis:
	- 1) born with blank slate, form habits from observations
	- 2) language is an innate ability like walking
	- 1st hyp can't be completely correct - learning language from scratch is too difficult
	- 2nd hyp too extreme inccorrect, or else everyone would speak the same language
- research suggests that there is a lot of built-in knowledge in process of language learning
	- controversy over how much is built-in
	- how much innate knowledge is specific to language (as opposed to acceptation of other systems)
- learning meanings of new words
	- babies learning meanings of words entirely from context
		- understand what the concept of a word is
- innateness hypothesis
	-
	-

- built-in notions to constrain what the child can imagine
	- known to exist for vision
- other biases/predetermined expectations
	- whole object bias
		- words taken to refer to whole objects, not just parts or properties
	- type bias
		- new word refers to a type of thing, not just to the particular thing
	- mind-reading bias
		- following eye-gaze shows that children have developed a theory of mind, that allows them to pick out other people's intentions
	- taxonymic and meronymic biases
		- if only one salient object in scene, and mutual exclusiveness preculdes existence of _____
- most child-directed speech are used when event referred to is NOT happening
	- e.g. "go to sleep"
- learn function words early
- count vs mass nouns

## Language is Innate Hypothesis
1. parents make mistakes (data is not consistent)
2. data is unsystematic (parents don't teach part by part)
	- e.g. vowels, then consonants, the morphemes, then phonology
3. data is incomplete (can't observe everything)
4. ungrammatical sentences are not normally corrected; correction seems to have little effect on the output
	- parents are focused on meaning; don't focus on grammaticality
	- correct pronunciation or word formation, but not grammar
	- children seem to ignore/resist grammatical correction

## Language is Learned Hypothesis
- mothers and caretakers go out of their way to simplify language and shorten sentences for easier understanding
- simplified vocabulary
- systematic simplification of phonology, higher pitch
- exaggerated intonation, short, simple sentences
- Newport, Gleitman, Gleitman in 1977 published study saying that "mother talk" is not simpler than actual language
	- progress towards fluency doesn't seem to be determined by mothering environment
- normal acquisition passes through stages
	- similar across languages
1. basic biological noises (0-8 wks)
2. social noises: cooing, laughing (8-20 wks)
3. vocal play: considerable range, different ones on different days, as if practicing (20-30 wks)
4. babbling: reduplication, variegated (25-50 wks)
	- can tell questions from statements, 
5. intonation, fixed melody, speech-like (9-18 mo)
	- begin to form words (12-18 mo)
	- recognize words more words, but only able to produce a few consonants

#### acquisition of phonology
1. initial consonants develop first
	- [p b k n f] d g m h
2. vowels initially by end of the 2nd year
3. consonants most problematic at age 4
	- [ th, del, dzh, zh]

#### errors in child language
1. fricative consonants replaced by stops
2. velar consonants replaced by alveolar consonants
	k -> t
3. clusters avoided; difficult until 4 or 5
4. dropping final consonants
5. dropping unstressed syllables
5. 'harmonizing' consonants:
	- dog -> gog; water -> wawa

- function listemes' meanings are the most abstract kind of meanings there are
	- e.g. 'a', '-ing', 'some'
- acquiring lexicon
	- underextension is more unusual
		- e.g. apple only for red apples
	- over extension is more common
		- e.g. usurp -> take
