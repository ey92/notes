# Intro
**language** is a system of rules mapping sounds/gestures and meanings
- mostly compositional
- idioms noncompositional

**grammar**
- descriptive grammar (observations)
- prescriptive grammar (guidelines how to contruct phrases)
- mental grammar

**morpheme**: "minimal strings of sounds associated with fixed meanings"
- may be words, but they may be smaller than words
-connection between sounds of a word and its meaning is mostly arbitrary
except
	* onomatopoeia
	* sound symbolism

sound instead of writing: humans have had language from the beginning 50,000yrs
- only literate about 5,000yrs
- infrequency of developing independent writing systems
- -> writing not central to language
- graphical way of representing sounds

representing sounds in writing
- no 'th' letter - multiple sounds for 'th'
- many letters have multiple sounds
- why use 2+ letters to represent sound?

**International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)**
- 1888
- phonetic alphabet with characters having simple, consistent sounds, based on the Roman alphabet
- one sound per character
- one character for every sound used distinctively in some language
- advantage of universality

**acoustic phonetics**: analysis of speech sounds in their physical aspect
_spectrograms_ produce graphs(_spectographs_) which map the _frequency_ (pulse/second) and intensity (_amplitude_) of vibrations over time


# Phonetics
## Phonetics 28/1
### Design features of language
---
- open-ended due to compositionality
- rule-governed
- mental grammars are generative
- rule-governed creativity -> understand new sentences; potentially infinite set of linguistic objects
- at each level, you can look at the objects that make up language from two different perspectives
	* **paradigmatic relationships** - what the chunks are, what categories they belong to
	* **syntagmatic relationships** - how they are put together (order, which ones work together)
- rules of grammar create 2D objects
	* language has linear order
	* but also hierarchical structure
- at level of sounds
	* phonetic features -> sound segments -> segments -> syllables, feet
	* **morphemes**: strings of sounds associated with fixed meanings, combine to form words usually ordered one after another
	* **free morphemes** - can stand by themselves as words
	* **bound morphemes** - can only occur in combination
- **word** - a free morpheme with all the bound morphemes attached to it
	*can a word be only made from bound morphemes?
- words -> phrases -> sentences

languages are learnable

---
**articulary phonetics** - looks at the way sounds are formed in the hman vocal tract
- "high-front vowel /i:/" vs "high-back vowel /u:/" vs "low vowel /a:/"
- physical position in mouth

**acoustic phonetics** - concerned with physical analysis of the speech sound
- _sound spectrogram_ (waveform) time x frequency
- _formant_ - uniform band of relativeley great intensity in the sound specturm over a particular frequency range

**perceptual phonetics** - concerned with the mechanisms of speech perception in the ear and the brain
- physical distrubances of air vibrating ear

separate from grammar: describes the physical/physiological phenomena outside the speaker's mind


### Consonants & Vowels
**consonants** involve some degree of obstruction of airflow
- **stop consonants** completely cut off airflow (hear consonant when air is released): t,g,b,p,m
	* on spectrogram: blank/d
- **fricative consonants** restrict airflow enough to create turbulence: f,v,th
**vowels** do not obstruct airflow but more concerned about the shape of the mouth

_semivowels_ /j/ /w/ phonetically (articulatorily and acousitcally) vowels /ɪ/ /ʊ/

Classifying Sounds
- egressive pulmonary sounds - begine with airflow from lungs
	* airflow passes through the larynx and ca be modified by vocal cords in larynx

larynx is dangerously close to esophogus opening
- protected by epiglotties
- gives more room to articulate more sounds

voicing
- **vocal bands** - two muscular folds inside larynx which vibrate with each other when close together
- **voiced sounds** - sounds articulated with vocal cords
- **whispering**: holding back part of vocal cords apart
- **glottal stops** - created by momentarily closing the vocal cords

#### Articulatory Phonetics
- stop
- fricative
- affricate
- voice (glottal gesture & vocal folds)

glottal stops
- not written in English, implied by phonology of words
- glottal fricative: [h]
- not possible to voice glottal stops

vowels are normally voicedconsonants may or may not be voiced

voiced sounds can be made loud or soft, or sung

Voice Onset Time
-if voicing coincides with the release of the consonant, consonant is voiceless
-_voiceless aspirated stops_
	- sometimes, voicing is delayed after the consonant is released, while vocal records are apart
	- shows up as friction on spectrogram

advanced voice onset 	/d/
coincident voice onset 	/t/ 		only occurs after fricatives
delayed voice onset 	/t^h/ 		doesn't occur after fricatives

nasal soound: velum is lowered

dissimilation: r-> get switched

Airstream Mechanisms
- glottalic sounds: air pressure builds up between glottis and articulator
	- egressive: ejectives; amerind, african, caucasian languages
	- ingressive: implosives; rare, found in some american, african, south asian language
- lingual sounds: air pressure from moving tongue
	- ingressive: clicks; only in khoisan languages of southern Africa and southern Bantu (Xhosa, Zulu)
- sibilants - special type of fricatives
	- high frequency
	- /s z ʃ ʒ/
- groove (sibilants) vs slit fricatives (th)
	- tongue shape

Secondary Articulations
- vocal tract is restricted articulations (co-articulations)
- labialization		kʷ
- palatalization	kʲ
- velarization		ɫ
- pharyngealization
- glottalization

---
Great Vowel Shift
- massive change in pronunciation of English long vowels, beginning in 1500s

parameters for vowels:
- part of tongue raised
- height of tongue
- position of palate (nasalization)
- lip position (round/spread)
- tenseness
- length (supersegmental)

-English front vowels are always unrounded, back vowels always rounded
- diphthongs are vowels plus glides
	- bit, beet 	[ɪ, i]
	- bet bait		[з, e]
	- pull, pool 	[ʊ, u]
	- 1st vowels are short and lax
	- 2nd vowels are long and tense, tending strongly towards dipthongization

Phonetic Features tend to be binary
- [ʊ] [+V, -C, +back, +high, +round, -tense]
- [n] [+C, +stop, +apical, +voice, +nasal]

typical languages have more than twice as many consonants as vowels
| language | consonants | vowels |
| -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Haida (Amerind) | 46 | 3 |
| Powaian (Indo-Pacific) | 12 | 10 |
| English | 24 | 11-13 |

Universal Implications
- in general, languages hae more 'marked' (unusual) sounds only if they have more 'unmarked' (usual) sounds
	- p -> k
	- k -> t except Hawaiian
	- g -> d
	- d -> b
	- m -> n
- relationships mirrored in frequency of sounds in languages
	- /n t d s/
	- /sh ts zh/
	- [ʃ tʃ dʒ ʒ]. 
- nasal iff oral stops
- voiced iff voiceless stops
- front rounded vowels iff back rounded vowels
- relative ease of pronunciation
- vowel systems tend to be symmetrical
	- probably because easier to differentiate

English vowels
- some vowels are being replaced by related vowels

Supersegmental/Prosodic Features
- stress - loudness relative to neighboring sounds (variation in amplitude of sound waves)
- pitch - different in frequency relative to neighboring sounds, due to increased tension of vocal bands and higher air pressure
- length - longer periods of *
- accent - includes stress, pitch, and length in combinations that vary from language to language
	- English stress accent language
	- accent placement can affect meaning of word
- tone
	- tonal languages have different meaning
	- English signals illocutionary type (statement, question, etc)
- span over syllables or phrases

Resonance

| Obstruants | vs | Sonorants |
| --------- | -- | ---------- |
| stops | | glides/semivowels |
| fricatives | | liquids |
| | | nasals |

- sonorant produced with continuous, non-turbulent airflow

# Phonology
English past tense
| verb ending | past tense ending|
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| alveolar stop (t/d) | -eed |
| voiced | -d |
| voiceless | -t |

1. **allomorphy**: - different forms of morphemes, called _allomorphs_, have predictable distribution based on phonetics of neighboring sounds
2. **natural classes**: don't have to list the sounds that trigger an allomorph one by one; identify by specifying one feature in common
- [+v] = [a l o j rr b n g z zh v ...]
- [+stop] = [p b g k n m t d ...]
- [+alveolar] = [s z t d ts ...]
- [+sibilant] = [s z zh ts dzh tsh ...] (high freq fricatives/affricatives)
- [-D past] /eed/ /t/ /d/
3. **Assimilation** - sounds tend to become more like the sounds around them
- consonants become voiced when adjacent to voiced sounds & vice versa
- [CF]:[+v]->[+v]_[+v]
- **dissimilations**: sounds that sound too similar change to be different
- flood/flooded
- cats, dogs, busses [+v$]->[s], [-v$]->[z] [sibilant]->[eez]
4. Mental grammars allows us to perceive sounds that aren't there
- bad at identifying speech sounds in isolation without linguistic context
- in context, we can recognize words before they are finished
	- knowledge of grammar enables us to guess what comes next
- people speak ~150-200 words per minute

## Allophones
[t^h] [t] [D] [?] are _allophones_ of the same _phoneme_
[d] [t] are different phonemes
	- 'done' & 'ton' differ in meaning and exactly one sound -> *minimal pair*

| | contrastive sounds | allophonic sounds | free variation |
| - | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| relation to phonemes | allophones of separate phonemes | allophones of same phoneme | allophones of same phoneme |
| distribution predictability | unpredictable | predictable | unpredictable |
| how to recognize | - contrastive distribution <br> - minimal pairs <br> - overlapping distribution with differences in meaning | complementary distribution | overlapping distribution with no difference in meaning
