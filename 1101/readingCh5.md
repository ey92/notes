# Chapter 5: Syntax
- component of mental grammar
- how sentences and phrases constructed out of smaller phrases and words
<br> <br>
**linguistic expression** - piece of language with form, meaning, and syntactic properties
- syntactic properties determine how to combine with other expressions
<br> <br>
- _grammatical_/syntactically well-formed
- _ungrammatical_ expressions/syntactically ill-formed
- _grammaticality judgment_ is reflection of native speaker's mental grammar, irrelevant from prescriptive grammar
<br> <br>
- syntax vs semantics: not mutually exclusive, since syntax can affect meaning
	- missing semantics -> strange meaning
	- missing syntax -> guess meaning or nonsense
- syntax can't be predicted or explained based on expression's meaning
- if syntax is meaning-related, would be similar across all languages
<br> <br>
- subject, object
- _principle of compositionality_: meaning of phrase depends on combined expressions and how syntactically connected
- _lexical expressions_ (e.g. words, idioms)
- _phrasal expressions_
<br> <br>
- _morphosyntax_: refers to morphology and syntax as a single grammar component

## Syntactic Properties
1. _word order_
 - linear order in which words can occur in some phrasal expression
 - set of syntactic properties of expressions that dictates how they can be ordered with respect to other expressions
2. _co-occurrence_
- set of syntactic properties that determines which expressions may or have to co-occur with some other expressions in a sentence

### Word Order
- English is SVO
- SOV (44%), SVO (35%), VSO (19%), VOS, OVS, OSV
- depends on context
	- German SVO main, SOV subordinate
	- English SVO main, VSO question
	- all 6 grammatical within some languages, but affects meaning
- **topicalization** - syntactic process (EN) where syntactic constituent occurs at the beginning of sentence to highlight topic
- ordering constraints
	- e.g. preposition precedes its object (EN), postpositions immediately follows noun phrase (JP)

### Co-Occurrence
#### Arguments
- _arguments_ & _complements_
- expressions with co-occurrence requirement
	- nouns need determiner (EN)
	- transitive verbs require subject and direct object (EN)
- arguments can include NP, PP, SUBJ, VP (obj inf)
- required arguments must be present, and no extras
- languages differ in co-occurrence restrictions
	- multiple determiners

#### Adjuncts
- attributive modifiers aka modifiers because they modify the meaning
- expressions whose occurrence is optional
- e.g. adjectives

##### Arguments vs Adjuncts
- expressions can be arguments or adjuncts, depending on context

![Arguments vs Adjuncts](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/1101/arguments-vs-adjuncts.png)

#### Agreement
- inflectional morphological form influences expression's co-occurrence requirements
- noun/adjective agreement: case, number, gender
- noun/verb agreement: number, gender, person

## Syntactic Constituency
- syntactic constituent
- determining a syntactic constituent: answer to question about sentence's meaning
	- "The cat was sleeping on the couch"
	- Where was the cat sleeping? On the couch.
- constituency tests not perfectly reliable & can have conflicting results

### Clefting
**cleft** - type of sentence that has general form It is/was X that Y (e.g., It was Sally that I wanted to meet)
- can be used as a constituency test
	- It was the cat that was sleeping on the couch.

### Pro-Form Substitution
**substitution** - constituency test where constituent replaced with single word (or simple phrase), such as a pro-form
**pro-form** - word (e.g. pronoun) that can replace a syntactic constituent
	- [She] was sleeping on the desk.
	- The cat was sleeping [there].
	- The cat was [doing so].
	- The cat was sleeping on [it].

other tests:
- coordination
- deletion
- topicalization
