## Ch. 1 Introduction
**linguist** - someone who studies the structure of language and its use

**language** - an abstract cognitive system that uniquely allows humans to produce and comprehend meaningful utterances

**linguistic competence** - the unconscious knowledge a speaker has about his or her native language

**linguistic performance** - the observable use of language/actualization of one's linguistic knowledge

**performance error** - errors in language production or comprehension, including hesitations and slips of the tongue

**communication chain**: source, transmitter, signal, receiver, destination

**noise** - interference in the communication chain

**phonetics** - study of minimal units of language (sounds)

	allows you to recognize sounds and words spoken by different speakers

**morphology** - the study of how words are constructed out of morphemes

**syntax** - component of mental grammar that deals with constructing phrasal expressions out of smaller expressions; subfield of linguistics that studies how expressions can combine to form larger expressions

**'grammatical'** - correct grammar, according to descriptive grammar, esp syntax

**'ungrammatical'** - not following descriptive grammartical rules, esp syntax

**semantics** - study of linguistic meaning

**pragmatics** - study of how context affects language use, whether or not it is by chance in a context and how the context affects the utterance's meaning or interpretation

**language acquisition** - process by which children acquire lexicon and grammatical rules of language

**language variation** - property of languages having different ways to express the same meanings in different contexts, according to factors such as geography, social class, gender, social class, etc.

**writing** - physical representation of language other than speech; adds an extra step to communcation process

**form** - the structure or shape of any particular linguistic item, from individual segments to strings of words

**linguistic sign** - combination of form and meaning; connection between form and meaning is typically arbitrary

**formal language** - communication system that has both semantic and syntactic rules and that encodes ideas with symbols that represent particular meanings, but could never be the native language of a human

**natural language** - a language that has evolved naturally in a speech community

**constructed language** - a language that has been designed by an individual or group of individuals for some particular purpose, such as use in a fictional world or international communication, but did not originate as the native language of any speech community

**modality** - mode of communication; tells us how the language is produced and how it is perceived
- **auditory-vocal**/**aural-vocal**/**spoken languages** - perceived via hearing & produced via speech
- **visual-gestural**/**signed languages** - perceived visually and produced via hand and arm movements, facial expressions, and head movements

**code** - an artificially constructed system for representing a natural language; borrows its structure from the natural language it represents; doesn't have native speakers e.g. Morse code

**distribution** - set of phonetic environments in which sound occurs
- _contrastive distribution_: two sounds occur in the same phonetic environment
- _complementary distribution_: two sounds never occur in same phonetic environment; allophones of same phoneme
- _free variation_: multiple pronunciations of given sound without changing word meaning

**phonetic environment** - sound that comes before and after a particular sound in a word

**basic allophone**/elsewhere allophone - allophone of a phoneme used when no change-inducing conditions fulfilled; least limited in where it can occur

**restricted allophone** - allophone of a phoneme that appears in more limited set of phonetic environments

**lexical category** - class of words grouped together based on morphological properties; part of speech
- _open lexical category_ - lexical category in which new members are often introduced
- _closed lexical category_ - lexical category in which new members are rarely introduced

**root** - free morpheme or bound root in a word that contributes the most semantic content to the word, to which affixes can attach
- _bound root_ - root has basic meaning but cannot stand alone as word

**derivation** - morphological process that can change a words' lexical category or its meaning in a predictable ways

**affix** - bound morpheme that attaches to a stem
- prefixes, suffixes

**stem** - base, consisting of at least one morpheme, to which affixes are added; includes root (+ affixes)

**inflection** - morphological process modifying to indicate grammatically relevat information (person, number, gender, tense); like derivation but creates forms of words instead of completely new words

**morpheme** - smallest linguistic unit with meaning or grammatical function
- _free morpheme_ - can be a word alone
- _bound morpheme_ - must be attached to a word stem, can't stand alone
- _content morpheme_ - morpheme carrying semantic content
- _function morpheme_ - morpheme providing information about grammatical relationships between words in sentence

**homophony** - phenomenon where 2+ distinct morphemes or nonphrasal linguistic expressions happen to have the same form

**productive** - descibes morpheme or rule that can be used to produce novel grammatical forms

**word formation process** - combination of morphemes according to rules of the language to make new wordsor forms of words

**affixation** - word formation process in which affixes added onto stems

**compounding** - word formation process in which whole words are combined

**reduplication** - word formation process in which new words formed by doubling part of or entire free morpheme
- _partial reduplication_
- _total reduplication_

**alternation** - morpheme-internal modification to make new word or morphological distinction

**suppletion** - one form can't be phonologically or morphologically derived from the other

**analytic language**/**isolating language** - type of language in which most words consist of one morpheme and sentences are composed of sequences of free morphemes; grammatical relationships depend on word order; e.g. Chinese, Vietnamese

**synthetic language** - language in which affixes attached to morphemes so word made of multiple meaningful elements
- **agglutinating language** - synthetic language in which relationships between words in sentence indicated by bound morphemes; morphemes bound loosely
	- **agglutinization** - putting morphemes together
- **fusional language** - synthetic language in which relationships between words in sentence are indicated by bound morphemes that are difficult to separate from stem
- **polysynthetic language** - synthetic language in which several affixes attached to stem to show grammatical relationships
	- **incorporation** - morphological process in which several distinct semantic components combined into single word

**input** - linguistic form before application of a rule or set of rules
