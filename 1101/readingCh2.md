# Chapter 2: Phonetics
phonetics: consonants, vowels, melodies, rhythms
- figuring out which sounds are possible is critical

## Representing Speech Sounds
### 3 aspects:
1\. _articulary phonetics_ - study of production of speech sounds
- which sounds are possible?
- which parts of the mouth are used?
- use x-rays, EM articulograph receptors, ultrasound
- palatography to observe tongue/roof of mouth contact, airflow, air pressure

2\. _acoustic phonetics_ - study of transmission and physical properties of speech sounds
- concerns characteristics of sounds produced by articulations
- use sound spectrograph
	- _formant_ - uniform band of relativeley great intensity in the sound specturm over a particular frequency range

3\. _auditory phonetics_ - study of perception of speech sounds
- how humans perceive pronunciation
- observe human responses to stimuli
- use MRI and CT
- impressionistic phonetic transcription
	- spelling is conventionalized to symbolize shared meaning, not pronunciation
	- avoid ambiguity:
		- each symbol should only represent on sound/phone & vice versa <c>
		- if two sounds can distinguish one word from another <th>
		- if two sounds very similar and difference comes from context, similarity should be represented <k> (_coarticulation_)
	- English is bad:
		- same sound is spelled using different letters
		- sometimes same letter has different sounds
		- sometimes single sound is spelled by combination of letters
		- sometimes single letter represents combination of sounds
		- sometimes letters don't represent any sound e.g. know, doubt, island
	- must be consistent and unambiguous 1-to-1 correspondence between sounds and symbols

### Types of Speech Sounds
1. _segments_
2. _suprasegmentals_

consonants vs. vowels

|  | consonants | vowels |
| - | ---------- | ------ |
| articulary  | produce constriction in vocal tract to impede airflow | slight narrowing & allow air to flow freely
| acoustically | usually less intense | usually more intense |
| auditory | - | prominent nucleus of each syllable |

- a _syllable_ can contains 1+ sounds & can be broken down into an _onset_ and a _rhyme_
- all syllables have a rhyme, but onset is optional in some languages
- _rhyme_ can be broken down into _nucleus_ and _coda_
- _vowels_ can be divided into 2 categories: _monophthongs_ and _diphthongs_

- _running speech_/_continuous speech_: we speak on a daily basis with words, phrases, sentences, run together
- pronunciation of words may be affected by surrounding words

## Articulation/Segmental Features
focus on segmental features:
- voiced or voiceless?
- where is airstream constricted?
- how is airstream constricted?

3 components of human anatomy for speech production:
- larynx/voice box
- vocal tract
- subglottal system

_pulmonic egressive airstream mechanism_ - speech formed when exhaling

### Consonant Articulation
---
#### 1. Voicing
- _voiced sounds_ are created when the vocal cords vibrate; _voiceless sounds_ are created when the vocal cords don't vibrate
- vocal folds also don't vibrate in whispering
- observe _spectrogram_ & _voicing bar_
- view vocal folds directly with tiny camera

#### 2. Place of Articulation
place in vocal tract where airflow is constricted

| type | description | example |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **bilabial** | bring both lips close together | [p] pat <br> [b] bat <br> [m] mat <br> [w] with <br> [w̥] where (for some) |
| **labiodental** | lower lip against upper front teeth | [f] fat | [v] vat |
|**interdentals** | tip of tongue protruding between front teeth | [θ] thigh <br> [ð] thy |
| **alveolar** | tongue tip at or near front of upper _alveolar ridge_ | [t] tab <br> [d] dab <br> [s] sip <br> [z] zip <br> [n] noose <br> [ɾ] atom <br> [l] loose <br> [ɹ] red |
| **post-alveolar** | front of tongue just behind _alveolar ridge_, front of _hard palate_ | [ʃ] leash <br> [ʒ] measure <br> [ʧ] church <br> [ʤ] judge |
| **palatal** | body of tongue near center of _hard palate_ | [j] yes |
| **velar** | produced at _velum_ | [k] kill <br> [ɡ] gill <br> [ŋ] sing |
| **glottal** | produced when air constricted at larynx | [h] high <br> [ʔ] glottal stop between vowels or middle of words (cotton) |

_alveolar ridge_ - bony ridges of upper and lower jaws that contain sockets for teeth
_hard palate_ - hard portion of roof of mouth
_velum_/_soft palate_ - soft part of roof of mouth behind hard palate

#### 3. Manner of Articulation
how the airstream is constricted or modified in the vocal tract to produce the sound
- depends on degree of closure of articulators
- glottal stop occurs in larynx, not oral cavity

| type | description | example |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **stops**/**plosives** | completely obstruct airstream in oral cavity | [p] <br> [b] <br> [t] <br> [d] <br> [k] <br> [g] <br> [m] <br> [n] <br> [ʔ] |
| **fricatives** | form nearly complete obstruction in vocal tract, noise called _frication_ | [f] <br> [v] <br> [θ] <br> [ð] <br> [s] <br> [z] <br> [ʒ] <br> [h] |
| **affricates** | briefly stop airstream completely and then slightly releasing articulators to produce frication <ul><li>begin with stop and end with fricative</li></ul> | [ʧ] <br> [ʤ] |
| **nasals** | relax and lower velum, opening nasal passage to vocal tract | 'nasal stops' <br> [m] <br> [n] <br> [ŋ] |
| **approximants** | constrict vocal tract but not narrow enough to block vocal tract or cause turbulence; includes _liquids_ and _glides_ | |
| <ul><li>**liquids**</li></ul> | formed with slightly more constriction than glides; quality changes depending on where in word, usually voiced in English | [l] <br> [ɹ] (commonly _retroflex_)|
| <ul><li>**glides**</li></ul> | slight closure of articulators, close to vowel sounds; require some gliding of articulators during production | [w] <br> [w̥] <br> [j] |
| **flap**/tap | complete obstruction of oral cavity, but faster closure than a stop | [ɾ] <br> ('ladder' 'writer') |

[ɹ]: voiced, alveolar <br>
_retroflex_ - curling tip of tongue behind alveolar ridge

[w]: voiced, labial-velar glide
[w̥]: voiceless

types of liquid:
- _rhotic_: [ɹ]
- _lateral_: [l] airstream proceeds along the sides of the tongue, but it is blocked by the tongue from going through the middle of the mouth

### 4. Nature/Part of the Obstructor
- labiodental vs bilabial
- tongue position/part
	* _apical_ (tongue tip) vs dorsal
	* _retroflex_ - bending tongue back
	* _lateral_ - letting air escape around sides

### 5. degree/type of obstruction
- stops
- flaps
- trills
- fricatives/spirants
- affricates
- liquids
- semivowels
---

- _syllabic consonants_: nasals and liquids can act as syllable nuclei
	- indicated by placing short vertical line below phonetic symbol
	- e.g.  [m̩], [l̩], [ɹ̩]

observing place and manner of articulation: **palatography** - picture where tongue touches roof of mouth during articulation
- _static palatography_: paint tongue black with mixture of olive oil and charcoal poweder
	- tongue leaves black trace wherever touched to make constriction when sound produced
	- only words if speaker produces single isolated sound and contact pattern photographed or examined immediately
- _dynamic palatography_: points of contact directly recorded on computer via artificial hard palate
	- can record sequences of contacts over course of an utterance
	- know place and duration of contact
	- hard to observe contact for soft palate region/velar consonants
- description typically voicing-place-manner

### Vowel Articulation
---
- consonants that surround vowels depend on it for audibility
- produced with open vocal tract, no place or manner of articulation (constriction), always voiced
- _low_ & _high_ vowels
- sound source is in vocal fold vibration, vocal tract acts as acoustic resonator, affecting quality of vowel
	- 4 main ways to change shape of vocal tract:
		- raising/lowering body of tongue
		- advancing/retracting body of tongue
		- rounding/not rounding lips
		- making movements with tense or lax gestures
- focus on monophthongs

#### English Vowel (Monophthong) Chart

![English Vowel (Monophthong) Chart](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/english-vowel-chart.gif)

#### 1. Tongue Height
| height | description | vowels |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ |
| high | raised tongue, front of mouth less open | [i] leak <br> [ɪ] lick <br> [u] Luke <br> [ʊ] look |
| mid | intermediate tongue height | [ɛ] bet <br> [ᴧ] but <br> [ɔ] bought <br> [ə] above |
| low | tongue lowered, front of mouth open | [æ] cat < br> [ɑ] cot |

most unstressed vowels pronounced as [ə] 

#### 2. Tongue Advancement
| place | description | vowels |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| front | tongue raised & pushed forward under hard palate | [i] seek <br> [ɪ] sick <br> [ɛ] sec <br> [æ] sack |
| central | no tongue advancement or retraction | [ᴧ] luck <br> [ə] another |
| back | tongue raised in back of mouth toward velum | [u] ooze <br> [ʊ] look <br> [ɔ] draw <br> [ɑ] dot |

#### 3. Lip Rounding
| | description | vowels |
| - | ----------- | ------ |
| rounded | lips are rounded | [u] loop <br> [ʊ] foot <br> [ɔ] paw |
| unrounded | lips are spread | [i] leak <br> [ɪ] lick <br> [ɛ] bet <br> [ᴧ] but <br> [ə] above <br> [æ] cat <br> [ɑ] cot |

#### 4. Tenseness
**tense** vowels have more extreme positions of tongue/lips than **lax vowels**
- more extreme tongue gestures from mid-central position to reach periphery of possible _vowel space_

| | |
| - | - |
| tense | [i] leak; [u] loop |
| lax | [ɪ] lick; [ʊ] foot; [ɛ] bet; [ᴧ] but; [ə] above; [ɔ] paw; [æ] cat; [ɑ] cot |

- diphthongs complex 2-part sounds, transition from one vowel to another in the same syllable
	- [ɑɪ] buy; [ɔɪ] boy; [oʊ] bow (performance); [eɪ] bay

**Airstream Mechanisms**
- _glottalic sounds_: air pressure builds up between glottis and articulator
	- egressive: ejectives; amerind, african, caucasian languages
	- ingressive: implosives; rare, found in some american, african, south asian language
- _lingual sounds_: air pressure from moving tongue
	- ingressive: clicks; only in khoisan languages of southern Africa and southern Bantu (Xhosa, Zulu)
- _sibilants_ - special type of fricatives
	- high frequency
	- /s z ʃ ʒ/
- _groove (sibilants)_ vs _slit fricatives_ (th)
	- tongue shape

Secondary Articulations
- vocal tract is restricted articulations (co-articulations)
- labialization		kʷ
- palatalization	kʲ
- velarization		ɫ
- pharyngealization
- glottalization

-English front vowels are always unrounded, back vowels always rounded
- diphthongs are vowels plus glides


## Suprasegmental Features
- **length**
	- vowel before voiced consonant ~1.5x longer
	- following consonant further back -> vowel longer
- **intonation** - pattern of pitch movements across a stretch of speech
	- rising = question, falling = statement
	- _pitch accents_ - change in fundamental frequncy in middle of utterance
	- _edge tones_ - pitch pattern right before a percieved break instead of middle of utterance
- **tone** - pitch at which the syllable of a word is pronounced
	- 2 types of tones: level or contour
	- not mutually exclusive with intonation
- **stress** - stress on a syllable
	- e.g. photograph vs. photography

## Acoustic Phonetics
soundwaves, compression, rarefaction, periodic waves
- recorded sound
- _harmonics_ & fundamental frequency
- vocal chords = source wave -> vocal tract = "filter" -> speech sound
- higher frequency, lower amplitude
- **formants** - peaks from filtering/resonant peaks of vocal tract

Vowels
- vowels have 3 important formants
- plotting f2 x f1 produces vowel chart

English Vowel Frequencies

| vowel | f1 | f2 | f3 |
| ----- | -- | -- | -- |
| [i] | 280 | 2250 | 2890 |
| [ɪ] | 400 | 1920 | 2560 |
| [ɛ] | 550 | 1770 | 2490 |
| [æ] | 690 | 1660 | 2490 |
| [u] | 310 | 870 | 2250 |
| [ʊ] | 450 | 1030 | 2380 |
| [ɔ] | 590 | 880 | 2540 |
| [ɑ] | 710 | 1100 | 2540 |

### Spectrograms
- stops cause gap
	- voiced stops still have _voice bar_
	- _aspiration_no clear formant, air released after stop closure & before vowel onset
- fricatives
	- fricative source wave not periodic, vs. vowels are periodic
	- English fricatives clearly differ in relative frequency
- nasals
	- nasal passage becomes filter for source
	- more similar formants
- nasals & liquids have abrupt change before consonant
- stops and glides have gradual changes
- glides also _semivowels_
- useful for preserving & analyzing speech
- natural speech not as clear and articulated 

## Phonetics in Signed Languages
5 **parameters** of articulation = segments
- place of articulation
- movement
- handshape
- hand orientation
- (non-manual markers)

_phones_/_primes_ combined differently than in spoken languages
- phones organized in linear temporal order, produced one at a time
- primes always occur simultaneously & can't stand alone

#### 1. Location
- _signing space_ general area where signs can be produced
	- reduced for 'whispering' and expanded for 'yelling'
- exact same gestures in different region changes meaning

#### 2. Movement
- direction & regions involved
- like vowels, meaning can be understood w/o movement

#### 3. Handshape
- multiple handshapes and movements
- differ in finger extension, position of thumb, fingers touching, etc.

#### 4. Orientation
- direction palms are facing, relative to each other or the speaker

#### 5. Non-Manual Markers
- facial expressions, head movements, gestures not made with hands
- more suprasegmental

- signs differ depending on language
- easier to study and record, very visible
