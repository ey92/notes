# Chapter 4: Morphology
**morphology** - study of how words are constructed out of morphemes; subset of mental grammar

### Morphemes and Derivation
**morpheme** - smallest linguistic unit with meaning or grammatical function
- free morphemes, bound morphemes
- _content morpheme_ - morpheme carrying semantic content: derivational affixes, bound roots, free roots in N/V/A/ADV
- _function morpheme_ - morpheme providing information about grammatical relationships between words in sentence: inflectional affixes, free roots in DET/PRN/CONJ
- free content morpheme = _content word_
- free function morpheme = _function word_
- phonological form, meaning, lexical category affect whether or not words are considered different forms of the same word or different words
- word length NOT indicator of number of morphemes

| | Content Morphemes | Function Morphemes |
| - | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Free Morphemes | _content words_: <ul><li>nouns</li><li>verbs</li><li>adjectives</li><adverbs</li></ul> | _function words_: <ul><li>determiners</li><li>prepositions</li><li>pronouns</li><li>conjunctions</li></ul> |
| Bound Morphemes | bound roots <br> derivational affixes | inflectional affixes |

![Morpheme Classification](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/1101/morpheme.png)

**lexical category/part of speech**
- open lexical category: often has new words
	e.g. noun, verb, adjective
- closed lexical category: rarely has new words
	e.g. pronoun, determiner, preposition, conjunction

- **root** - free morpheme or bound root in a word that contributes the most semantic content to the word
- bound roots: can't stand alone, often borrowed from other languages and not _productive_
- **derivation** - morphological process of changing PoS or meaning
- **stem** - base consisting of at least one morpheme
- **affix** - bound morpheme added to stem
	- prefixes, infixes, suffixes

**inflection** - morphological process modifying to indicate grammatically relevat information (person, number, gender, tense)
- like derivation but creates forms of words instead of completely new words

**homophony** - 2+ morphemes have same form (sound)
e.g. fast -> faster || speak -> speaker


#### Common Inflectional affixes in English
| Attach to | Affix(es) | Function | Example |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| verbs | -s | 3P S present | waits |
| verbs | -ed | past | waited |
| verbs | -ing | progressive aspect | waiting |
| verbs | -en, -ed | past participle | eaten, tasted |
| nouns | -s | plural | chairs |
| adjectives, adverbs | -er | taller, faster |
| adjectives, adverbs | -est | tallest, fastest |

## Morphological Processes
**word formation process** - combination of morphemes according to rules of the language to make new wordsor forms of words
#### 1. **Affixation** - adding affixes to stems
#### 2. **Affixation in Signed Languages** - can occur simultaneously, but usually inflectional
#### 3. **Compounding** - combine 2+ independent words (free morphemes, affixed words, compounded words)
- can be written as one word, hyphenated word, or multiple words
- stress pattern as if same word, instead of phrase - primary stress on first word only, instead of independent stresses
- common in German

#### 4. **Reduplication** - repeat entire or part of free morpheme
- _reduplicant_ - morpheme or part of morpheme duplicated in reduplication
- _partial reduplication_
- _total reduplication_
- inflectional or derivational; often used to convey intensity

#### 5. **Alternation** - morpheme-internal modification to make new word or morphological distinction
- mark morphological distinctions, although affecting phonology
- e.g. inflectional: man/men, goose/geese; ring/rang/rung, feed/fed/fed, hold/held/held; break/broke/broken, bite/bit/bitten, fall/fell/fallen, give/gave/given
- e.g. derivational: strife/strive, teeth/teethe, use/use

#### 6. **Suppletion** - one form can't be phonologically or morphologically derived from the other
- e.g. is/was, go/went, good/better/best, bad/worse,worst

## Morphological Types of Languages
2 types: Analytic/Isolated & Synthetic
- languages can show mix of features and change from one category to another over time

### Analytic/Isolated Language
- most words consist of single morpheme
- add invariant function word instead of affixes
- grammar depends on word order
- no morphological processes at all
- e.g. Chinese

### Synthetic Language
- words consist of several morphemes
- bound morphemes add meaning to stem or grammatical function
- subcategories

#### 1. Agglutinating Language
**agglutinization** - putting morphemes together
- easy to tell where morphemes were added
- each bound morpheme only carries one meaning
- e.g. Hungarian, Swahili

#### 2. Fusional Language
- also combines morphemes
- hard to tell when morphemes start/end
- bound morpheme can have several simultaneous meanings
- e.g. Spanish, Russian

#### 3. Polysynthetic Language
- words formed by combining several stems and affixes
- **incorporation** of objects into verbs
- e.g. Sora
