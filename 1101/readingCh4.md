# Chapter 4: Morphology
**morphology** - study of how words are constructed out of morphemes; subset of mental grammar

### Morphemes and Derivation
**morpheme** - smallest linguistic unit with meaning or grammatical function
- free morphemes, bound morphemes
- _content morpheme_ - morpheme carrying semantic content: derivational affixes, bound roots, free roots in N/V/A/ADV
- _function morpheme_ - morpheme providing information about grammatical relationships between words in sentence: inflectional affixes, free roots in DET/PRN/CONJ
- free content morpheme = _content word_
- free function morpheme = _function word_
- phonological form, meaning, lexical category affect whether or not words are considered different forms of the same word or different words
- word length NOT indicator of number of morphemes

| | Content Morphemes | Function Morphemes |
| - | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Free Morphemes | _content words_: <ul><li>nouns</li><li>verbs</li><li>adjectives</li><adverbs</li></ul> | _function words_: <ul><li>determiners</li><li>prepositions</li><li>pronouns</li><li>conjunctions</li></ul> |
| Bound Morphemes | bound roots <br> derivational affixes | inflectional affixes |

![Morpheme Classification](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/1101/morpheme.png)

##### bound vs free
- **root** - free morpheme or bound root in a word that contributes the most semantic content to the word
- _bound roots_: can't stand alone, often borrowed from other languages and not _productive_
- **stem** - base consisting of at least one morpheme
- **affix** - bound morpheme added to stem
	- prefixes, infixes, suffixes

##### productivity
**lexical category/part of speech**
- _open lexical category_: often has new words
	e.g. noun, verb, adjective
- _closed lexical category_: rarely has new words
	e.g. pronoun, determiner, preposition, conjunction

##### inflection vs derivation
- **derivation** - morphological process of changing PoS or meaning
	- not productive
- **inflection** - morphological process modifying to indicate grammatically relevant information (person, number, gender, tense)
	- like derivation but creates forms of words instead of completely new words
- derivational morphology always occurs before inflectional morphology

**homophony** - 2+ morphemes have same form (sound)
e.g. fast -> faster || speak -> speaker


#### Common Inflectional affixes in English
| Attach to | Affix(es) | Function | Example |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| verbs | -s | 3P S present | waits |
| verbs | -ed | past | waited |
| verbs | -ing | progressive aspect | waiting |
| verbs | -en, -ed | past participle | eaten, tasted |
| nouns | -s | plural | chairs |
| adjectives, adverbs | -er | taller, faster |
| adjectives, adverbs | -est | tallest, fastest |

## Morphological Processes
**word formation process** - combination of morphemes according to rules of the language to make new wordsor forms of words
#### 1. **Affixation** - adding affixes to stems
#### 2. **Affixation in Signed Languages** - can occur simultaneously, but usually inflectional
#### 3. **Compounding** - combine 2+ independent words (free morphemes, affixed words, compounded words)
- derivational, can be written as one word, hyphenated word, or multiple words
- PoS determined by last word, semantic meaning not as easy to tell
- stress pattern as if same word, instead of phrase - primary stress on first word only, instead of independent stresses
- common in German

#### 4. **Reduplication** - repeat entire or part of free morpheme
- _reduplicant_ - morpheme or part of morpheme duplicated in reduplication
- _partial reduplication_
- _total reduplication_
- inflectional or derivational; often used to convey intensity

#### 5. **Alternation** - morpheme-internal modification to make new word or morphological distinction
- mark morphological distinctions, although affecting phonology
- e.g. inflectional: man/men, goose/geese; ring/rang/rung, feed/fed/fed, hold/held/held; break/broke/broken, bite/bit/bitten, fall/fell/fallen, give/gave/given
- e.g. derivational: strife/strive, teeth/teethe, use/use

#### 6. **Suppletion** - one form can't be phonologically or morphologically derived from the other
- e.g. is/was, go/went, good/better/best, bad/worse,worst

## Morphological Types of Languages
2 types: Analytic/Isolated & Synthetic
- languages can show mix of features and change from one category to another over time

### Analytic/Isolated Language
- most words consist of single morpheme
- add invariant function word instead of affixes
- grammar depends on word order
- no morphological processes at all
- e.g. Chinese

### Synthetic Language
- words consist of several morphemes
- bound morphemes add meaning to stem or grammatical function
- subcategories

#### 1. Agglutinating Language
**agglutinization** - putting morphemes together
- easy to tell where morphemes were added
- each bound morpheme only carries one meaning
- e.g. Hungarian, Swahili

#### 2. Fusional Language
- also combines morphemes
- hard to tell when morphemes start/end
- bound morpheme can have several simultaneous meanings
- e.g. Spanish, Russian

#### 3. Polysynthetic Language
- words formed by combining several stems and affixes
- **incorporation** of objects into verbs
- e.g. Sora

## Hierarchical Structure of Derived Words
- stems to which affixes are joined to (_input_) are of same lexical category
- resulting word (_output_) also in the same lexical category
- can trace a word's derivational history based on _hierarchical structure_

#### Morphological Hierarchy
![Morphological Hierarchy](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/1101/morphological-hierarchy.png)


#### Ambiguous Morpheme Hierarchy
![Ambiguous Morpheme Hierarchy](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/1101/ambiguous-morpheme-hierarchy.png)

#### Some Morphemes Attach to Multiple Lexical Categories
| V -> V | N -> Adj | Adj -> Adj |
| ------ | -------- | ---------- |
| preexist <br> preapprove <br> predetermine <br> | prewar <br> preseason <br> pregame | prefrontal <br> prehistoric |

## Morphological Analysis
impossible to isolate morphemes by intuition
- begin with comparing words with similar meaning and sharing a morpheme
	- learn morpheme root and alternations
- similarity in meaning not necessarily matched by similarity in form
- inflections not universal among all languages (often assumed)

### Procedure
1. Isolate and compare forms that are partially similar, as we did for Classical Greek [ɡrapʰ-ɛː] and [ɡrapʰ-ɔː].
2. If a single phonetic form has two distinct meanings, it must be analyzed as representing two different morphemes (as in (3)).
3. If the same function and meaning are associated with different phonetic forms, these different forms all represent the same morpheme (i.e., they are allomorphs of the morpheme), and the choice of form in each case may be predictable on the basis of the phonetic environment (as in (4)).
