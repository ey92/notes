# Chapter 1: Introduction
## 3 Types of Grammar:
1) _mental grammar_
	- set of elements and rules of language system
	- rules that cannot be incorrect, despite differences from other speakers
2) _descriptive grammar_
	- objective description of a speaker's or group of speakers' knowledge of a language (competence) based on their use of the language (performance)
	- provides better picture of speaker's language competence
	e.g. some sentences end with preposition, some infinitives are split, some use double negatives
3) _prescriptive grammar_
	- a set of rules designed to give instructions regarding the socially embedded notion of the "correct" or "proper" way to speak or write
		e.g. don't end with preposition, don't split infinitives, don't use double negatives

## Knowing a Language:
1) recognizing sounds that are part of the language
2) breaking down words into parts with meaning or function
3) morphology
4) syntax - combine & form phrases
5) semantics - understanding & forming meaning

## Linguistic Competence:
1) lexicon
2) rules/mental grammar
	- _grammar_: language system, set of elements and rules (phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics)
	- _rule_: statement of pattern that occurs in language, including how to combine sounds form 
	utterances

## Non-essential Aspects of Language:
1) _writing_
	- writing is less basic than speech:
		- writing must be taught
		- not all languages are written
		- neurolinguistic evidence - writing activates same parts of brain as speech + more
		- writing can be edited before sharing/ speech is spontaneous
		- archaeological evidence that writing came later than spoken language
	- why writing might be considered more 'perfect' than speech
		- can be edited - more organized, fewer errors, pauses
		- must be taught and associated with education
		- more physically stable
2) _prescriptive grammar_
	mark social identity & used for social mobility
	easier for nonstandard dialect speakers to explicitly learn standard dialect

## Design Features of Language (Hockett)
- a set of 9 descriptive characteristics of language necessary for a communication system to be considered a language
- all systems have first 3, only human have last 2
1. _mode of communication_
	- e.g. voice, gestures
2. _semanticity_
	- property of having signals that convey a meaning, shared by all communication systems
	- hear a word you don't know, assume it has meaning
3. _pragmatic function_
	- systems must serve useful purpose - help survival, influence others' behavior, exploring the world
4. _interchangeability_
	- ability of individuals to both transmit and receive messages
5. _cultural transmission_
	- aspects of language that can only be acquired via communicative interaction with other users
6. _arbitrariness_
	- refers to the fact that a word's meaning is not predictable from its linguistic form nor its meaning
	- nonarbitrariness: form represents meaning directly (iconic/picture-like)
		- evidence: cross-linguistic comparisons
		- onomatopoeia - a nonarbitrary aspect of language where the words imitate natural sounds or meaning is associated with nature
		- sound symbolism - phenomenon where certain sounds are evocative of a particular meaning
			e.g. 'small' have 'i' sound (teeny, wee, mikros); 
				use high-pitched vowel because small objects give off high pitched sounds
		- speakers well-aware of nonarbitrary aspects and often used in poetry for example
7. _discreteness_
	- property of language that allows discrete units to be combined into larger communicative units
	- every language has limited number of sounds, but the ability to combine them in so many ways to express many ideas makes them useful
8. _displacement_
	- the ability of a language to communicate about things, actions, and ideas that aren't present in space or time while speakers are communicating (or just things that don't exist)
9. _productivity_
	- capacity of communication system for novel messages built out of discrete units to be produced and understood
	- differs from discreteness in that the units can be recombined into new messages and still be understood
	- understood because there are rules for how to put the sounds/morphemes/words together
	- rules at all levels of linguistic structure are productive & grant the ability to communicate about broad range of ideas

languages have all 9 parts, but does having them make a communication system a language?
- formal languages aren't natural languages
- constructed languages have the potential to become natural languages if learned by native speakers and adopted by speech community (e.g. modern hebrew)
- must be learnable

## Language Modality
- _auditory-vocal/aural-oral/spoken languages_
	- misconception that language is inseparable from speech comes from interchanging terms speech and language
- _visual-gestural/signed languages_
	- usually used by those with hearing difficulties
	- an be acquired as a first language
	- other than modality, similar to spoken languages in every other way
	- misconceptions:
		- 1\. _signed language_ vs. _manual codes_: signed languages are NOT derived from spoken languages and evolve naturally and independently of spoken languages
			- British Sign Language & American Sign Language are unrelated
			- manual codes for spoken languages exist
			- true languages are more efficient than signed codes
		- 2\. _signed language_ vs. _pantomime_: false impression that signers draw pictures in air or act out the meaning
			- 2 misconceptions:
			- a\. signed languages don't have internal structure but governed by the same sorts of phonological, morphological, syntactic rules that govern spoken languages
			- b\. signed language words are completely iconic; if true, no need to learn
			- association signs to meanings are still arbitrary (even if iconic when introduced, evolved to become more arbitrary)
			- pantomime idea would restrict signed language from being able to communicate about abstract concepts
		- 3\. _universality of signed languages_ - there is NOT only one signed language
			- may come from the idea of the pantomime myth, where iconicity would lend itself to universality
	- when large enough proportion of a population is deaf, the rest are fluent in signing
	- hard to represent in 2D
- studying different modalities allow linguists to observe things such as minimum pause length in spoken language but no minimum pause in signed language
