# Chapter 7: Pragmatics
**pragmatics** - study of how context affects language use, whether or not it is by chance in a context and how the context affects the utterance's meaning or interpretation
- how people use language in actual conversation
- how context helps determine whether utterance is appropriate and how context changes alter sentence meanings

## Languages in Context
- ignoring context can misrepresent meaning
- sentence: phrasal expression expressing some (complete) idea
	- doesn't have _context_
- utterance: event in which sentence is used
	- share properties such as language and length with sentence
	- also has time, place, volume, speaker
	- **diectic expression** - word or expression that takes its meaning relative to the time, place, and speaker of the utterance (e.g. there, now)
- "Is he there now?" (there, now)
- "Can you take the trash out?" (order vs question of ability)

#### Types of Context
1. **linguistic context**: discourse immediately preceding utterance in question
2. **situational context**: aspect of context including where/who speaking, what is going on around them, and what is happening in world that all speakers can reasonably be expected to be aware of
3. **social context**: aspect of an utteranceâ€™s context including social relationships between participants, their relative statuses to each other, etc

#### Felicity: Appropriateness in Context
- determine whether utterance is appropriate in given setting
- **felicitous** - utterance is appropriate for the context in which it is uttered
- **infelicitous** - utterance is not appropriate for the context in which it is uttered
	- can result from:
		- violation of one of the Gricean maxims, 
		- lack of fulfillment of some felicity condition
		- unsatisfied presupposition, 
		- some other source
	- marked with pound sign

## Rules of Conversation
- governed by social rules and functional rules to protect integrity of communication
- assume honesty of conversation partner & intent to communicate information

**Cooperative Principle** - principle formulated by philosopher HP Grice, stating that underlying a conversation is the understanding that what one says is intended to contribute to the purposes of the conversation
	- being cooperative depends on the context
	- _conversational maxims_ guiding conversational actions prevent meaningless conversations

### Grice's Maxims
1. Quality: expectations of honesty
	1. Do not say what you believe to be false
	2. Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence
	- people can differ in what they think is good evidence
2. Relevance: maintain organization of conversation by preventing random topic shifts
	1. Be relevant
		- allows _inferences_ - conclusion that is drawn from an implication or an implicature
3. Quantity: how much information is appropriate for speaker to give
	1. Make your contribution as informative as required
	2. Do not make your contribution more informative than is required
4. Manner: how information is given and is to be interpreted
	1. Avoid obscurity of expression
		- avoid _jargon_: terms restricted primarily to specialized areas of knowledge
	2. Avoid ambiguity
	3. Be brief
	4. Be orderly
		- organize information in some intelligent way
<br><br>
- 1st 3 categories related to information speaker expected to give or not give
- last category related to manner of information delivery and interpretation
<br><br>
Grice's Maxims can be exploited or flouted to communicate indirectly
- maxim is flouted when literal meaning of utterance appears to violate a maxim, but listener understands meaning due to shared understanding of maxims
- done to avoid hurting someone
- in competition with social rules

## Drawing Conclusions
### Entailment
- commitment for speaker
- confident conclusions
	- can often conclude more than what was entailed

### Inference, Implication, Implicature
- draw inferences based on assumption that speaker is following Cooperative Principle
- _implication_, _inference_
- speaker implying something -> utterance contains _implicature_

#### Implicature Based on Maxim of Relevance
- (X) "I'd like a cup of coffee. "
- (Y) "There's a place around the corner called Joe's."
	- (Z) Joe's sells coffee (not entailed)
	- Y _implicates_ Z

#### Implicature Based on Maxim of Quantity
- (X) "Have you finished all your homework?"
- (Y) "I finished my history homework."
	- (Z) I did not finish my other homework
	- possible that all other hw also done, but because information provided is less than requested, Z will likely be inferred

#### Implicature Based on Maxim of Manner
- (X) "Rebecca took the medication and had an allergic reaction."
	- infer that medication caused allergic reaction
- (Y) "Rebecca had an allergic reaction and took the medication."
	- infer that medication taken to remedy allergic reaction
- assume speaker is telling story in order
- (X) "The man who lives with me is an electrician."
	- infer that speaker unrelated to electrician
- assume speaker would have used shorter phrase (e.g. brother, husband) if true
- lengthier phrase implies that a more concisely stated relation is not true

#### Implicature Based on Maxim of Quality
- (X) "We need someone to make a cake for the picnic."
- (Y) "I can make my family's favorite chocolate cake."
	- (Z) I have succeeded in making this cake before.
- infer that evidence for being able to make the cake is previous experience

#### Significance of Implicature in Communication
- implicature as side effect of Grice's maxims
- allow speaker to introduce ideas with less commitment than if use entailment
- easier communication - don't have to spell out everything in a conversation

## Speech Acts
- describes speaker's use of speech to emphasize goal or intention of utterance

#### Common Speech Acts
| Speech Act | Function |
| ---------- | -------- |
| assertion | convey information |
| question | elicit information |
| request | (more or less politely) elicit action or information |
| order | demand action |
| promise | commit speaker to an action |
| threat | commit speaker to an action that hearer doesn't want |

#### Felicity Conditions
- set of conditions that must hold for a speech act to be felicitous
- felicity conditions for requests:
	- speaker believes action hasn't been done yet
	- speaker wants the action done or should be done for some reason
	- speaker believes hearer is able to do action
	- speaker believes hearer may be willing to do that kind of thing for the speaker
- felicity conditions for questions:
	- speaker doesn't know some piece of information about some state of affairs
	- speaker wants to know information about state of affairs
	- speaker believes hearer may be able to supply information about state of affairs that speaker wants

#### Performative Verbs and Performative Speech Acts
- _performative speech act_ - speech act in which verb is accomplished in performance of speech act itself
- _performative verbs_ - purely linguistic actions
	- promise, ask, assert, request, warn, threaten, bet, advise
- 2 requirements to be performative
	1. subject must be first person
	2. verb must be present tense
	- "hereby test": insert "hereby" before performative verb

#### Direct & Indirect Speech Acts
- _direct speech act_: utterance that performs its function in a direct and literal manner
	- includes performative speech act
	- often performed indirectly, especially when polite

- _indirect speech act_: utterance that performs its function in an indirect and nonliteral manner
	- speaker's meaning different from what is literally said
	- test:
		- felicity conditions broken for literal meaning but not intended meaning
		- standard response different from what literal meaning would result in

| Speech Act | Direct | Indirect |
| - | - | - |
| question | Did John marry Helen? | I don't know if John married Helen. <br> Do you know whether John married Helen? |
| request | (Please) take out the garbage. | The garbage hasn't been taken out yet. <br> Could you take out the garbage? |

- sentence types (interrogative, imperative) different from speech acts (assertion, question, request)

## Presupposition
- underlying assumption that speaker and participants believe prior to making utterance
- must be satisfied in order for utterance's truth value to be debatable
- _existence presupposition_ - presupposition that item referred to in discourse exists
- test:
	- if sentence and its logical negation both seem equally untrue, sentence likely has unsatisfied presupposition
	- _presupposition triggers_: words or phrases whose use in a sentence often indicates the presence of a presupposition (e.g. come back, too)
	- prosody: changed pitch accents to force different information to be presupposed
<br><br>
- _presupposition accommodation_ - process by which participants in discourse decide to accept (and not question) information that is presupposed by a sentence uttered in the discourse, even though the presupposition was not satisfied prior to the utterance
- requirements:
	- plausibility - only tend to accommodate presuppositions that we find plausible
	- accessibility - presupposition knowledge is inaccessible
