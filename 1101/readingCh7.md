# Chapter 7: Pragmatics
**pragmatics** - study of how context affects language use, whether or not it is by chance in a context and how the context affects the utterance's meaning or interpretation
- how people use language in actual conversation
- how context helps determine whether utterance is appropriate and how context changes alter sentence meanings

## Languages in Context
- ignoring context can misrepresent meaning
- sentence: phrasal expression expressing some (complete) idea
	- doesn't have _context_
- utterance: event in which sentence is used
	- share properties such as language and length with sentence
	- also has time, place, volume, speaker
	- **diectic expression** - word or expression that takes its meaning relative to the time, place, and speaker of the utterance (e.g. there, now)
- "Is he there now?" (there, now)
- "Can you take the trash out?" (order vs question of ability)

#### Types of Context
1. **linguistic context**: discourse immediately preceding utterance in question
2. **situational context**: aspect of context including where/who speaking, what is going on around them, and what is happening in world that all speakers can reasonably be expected to be aware of
3. **social context**: aspect of an utteranceâ€™s context including social relationships between participants, their relative statuses to each other, etc

#### Felicity: Appropriateness in Context
- determine whether utterance is appropriate in given setting
- **felicitous** - utterance is appropriate for the context in which it is uttered
- **infelicitous** - utterance is not appropriate for the context in which it is uttered
	- can result from:
		- violation of one of the Gricean maxims, 
		- lack of fulfillment of some felicity condition
		- unsatisfied presupposition, 
		- some other source
	- marked with pound sign

## Rules of Conversation
- governed by social rules and functional rules to protect integrity of communication
- assume honesty of conversation partner & intent to communicate information

**Cooperative Principle** - principle formulated by philosopher HP Grice, stating that underlying a conversation is the understanding that what one says is intended to contribute to the purposes of the conversation
	- being cooperative depends on the context
	- _conversational maxims_ guiding conversational actions prevent meaningless conversations

### Grice's Maxims
1. Quality: expectations of honesty
	1. Do not say what you believe to be false
	2. Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence
	- people can differ in what they think is good evidence
2. Relevance: maintain organization of conversation by preventing random topic shifts
	3. Be relevant
	- allows _inferences_ - conclusion that is drawn from an implication or an implicature
3. Quantity: how much information is appropriate for speaker to give
	4. Make your contribution as informative as required
	5. Do not make your contribution more informative than is required
4. Manner
	6. Avoid obscurity of expression
		- avoid _jargon_: terms restricted primarily to specialized areas of knowledge
	7. Avoid ambiguity
	8. Be brief
	9. Be orderly
		- organize information in some intelligent way

- 1st 3 categories related to information speaker expected to give or not give
- last category related to manner of information delivery and interpretation

<br><br>
Grice's Maxims can be exploited or flouted to communicate indirectly
- maxim is flouted when literal meaning of utterance appears to violate a maxim, but listener understands meaning due to shared understanding of maxims
- done to avoid hurting someone
- in competition with social rules
