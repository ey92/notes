# Introduction
- companies invest in IT to increase productivity
	- suggests capital to labor substitution
- **productivity** - output per employee per hour

## Productivity Paradox
**productivity paradox**: over 1975-1990, IT investment dramatically increasing, but productivity has been stagnant

### simple explanations:
1. measuring average productivity per employee (poor measurement)
	- some dramatically increase productivity while others' productivity drop
2. technology isn't used properly, can even be a distraction
3. time lag: delay in productivity increase
	1. training
	2. adapt tech for organization (customization), combined with secondary tech -> takes a long time
	3. adapt the organization to use IT (_business process engineering BPE_)

- optimal application of tech is between _ii_ and _iii_

e.g. electricity & redesigning factories ~ 40yrs
- estimating productivity delay is critical for high-tech companies
evidence: productivity shot up in 1990-1998, internet 2003-2016

### complex explanations:
1. time lag
	- evidence: time graph
2. misuse argument
	- for every business that uses IT properly gets a productivity increase, and two that don't
	- wasted effort -> no productivity, gains and losses cancel, average productivity doesn't change
	- may lead to more delay in productivity
	- also contributes to delay
		* companies that fail to integrate new technology take time to go out of business, which leads to increase of average productivity
	- evidence:
		- firm-level data
			* bimodal distribution of productivity
		- failures
			* 20% coporate IT projects fail within a year
			* more for startups and ecommerce
			* high variance suggests averages don't reflect productivity (self-reported is lower than actual failure)

investment into IT doesn't guarantee success

## Why is IT so complex?
Many techologies, and many tools for each

### Tool-Task Fit (Techology-Strategy Fit from organization perspective)
3 steps of fitting:
1. pick the right tool for the task
2. customize the tool for the task
3. reengineer the task for the tool
same reasons for delay in productivity

## Ecommerce is complex
Advantages
1. Reach: can reach more customers, over longer distances, at a lower cost, any time
	- lower customer acquisition cost
2. Richness: higher quality and complexity of information delivered to customers at lower cost
	- e.g. multimedia, customized product descriptions and recommendations
	- lower information deliver cost
3. Interactivity: form a stronger relationship with your customers
	- receive information back from your customers such as orders, reviews, preferences, and recommendations
	- lower information collection cost
	- #1-3 myths of electronic commerce
	- valid potential advantages, but very difficult to utilize
	- success in any 3 is rare
4. Ubiquity
	- consumers expend extra effort to reach traditional marketplace
	- marketspace is removed from temporal or geographic location
	- reduces transaction costs - cost of participating in market
	- reduces cognitive energy/mental effort to shop
5. Universal Standards
	- technical standards are universal
	- traditional commerce technology differs in each country
	- lower market entry costs (selling products)
	- lower search costs (finding products)
	- _price discovery_ faster, more accurate, easy to compare
6. Information Density
	- ecommerce tech reduces cost of
		- information collection
		- information storage
		- information processing
		- communication
	- increase currency, accuracy, timeliness of information
	- information is plentiful, cheaper, higher quality
	- price transparency, cost transparency
	- merchants can segment market, allowing for
		- price discrimination
		- cater to consumer preferences
7. Personalization/Customization
	- _customization_ - changing the delivered product or service based on a user's preferences or prior behavior
		- past purchases
		- browsing history
8. Social Technology
	- many-to-many model of mass communications
	- create, edit, and distribute content
	- social shopping and reputation

## Amazon
- successful in advantages 1-3
profitable?
- finally started making money in 2015-2016
- lost $1B over revenues of $3B in 2001
	- spent the money on advertisement
### transformation
books -> department store -> mall -> software and cloud services -> hardware: tablets -> streaming & content provider -> logistics & warehousing -> delivery -> grocery

- Amazon vs. Stone Soup in 1999
	* created a platform for selling items without providing any of the content
	* _intermediaries_ - facilitators of transactions between buyers and sellers
	* no physical processing, inventory, books, buildings, or significant physical existence
	* _infomediaries_ - intermediaries with no significant physical existence

## Constant Change as a Business Strategy
Why is constant change a good strategy good for IT business?
e.g. Google -> automobiles; Uber -> trucking; Apple -> music
1. Ease of Imitation
	- to prevent competitors from imitating, you create an arms race of technologies
	constantly build up on the lead that you hve
	e.g. Snapchat, iPhone, Bitcoin
2. Synergies between Technologies
	- there are shared components among many technologies
	- one the shared component is in place, expanding into new areas is cheap with high returns
	e.g. cloud computing by Google and Amazon, ebay & payment
3. Substitutability of Technologies
	- threats can come from anywhere, because there s substitutability among technologies
	- Google Search threatened by Facebook; search vs. social networks
	- "social shopping"
4. Fast-Changing Technology Environment
	- there is a fast-changing high tech environment
	- easy to become irrelevant quickly
	- similar problem with social institutions
		e.g. law, religion, government, education, family are designed to be rigid and inflexible
	- virtual instutions can explore the possibility of designing more flexible institutions using technology

## Impact of IT
- intense in 2 areas
- _intermediation_ - bringing buyers and sellers together to facilitate exchange of goods and services
	* _organizing_ and _coordinating_ efforts to produce goods and services
- _management_:setting goals, communicating goals, coordinating efforts to achieve the goals
- information intensive jobs require extensive communication and information processing
- IT is designed to support communication and information processing

## 2 Hypotheses
1. IT is the tool of trade for managers and ofen lead to new forms and styles of management
2. IT is a significant tool for intermediaries, and often leads to new types of intermediation
Questions: 
- What does IT do for managers and intermediaries?
- How can they adapt the technology to create a better fit for the organization?
- How do managers and intermediaries change themselves to take advantage of the technologies optimally?


# Communication
- communication technologies provide simple examples for several complex concepts
	-tool-taks  fit, business processs reengineering
		* webcasting and conferencing: consulting, education
	- impact of IT on management
		* doc sharing, coordination
	- impact of IT on intermediaries

## classification
- criteria: mode, content, scope
| _mode_ | example |
| - | - |
| synchronous | call |
| asynchronous | email (stored for your convenience) |

_content_
- text, graphics, audio, video

| _scope_ | example |
| - | - |
| 1:1 | call, mail |
| 1:many | lecture, books/publications, web pages |
| many:1 | web transactions, mailboxes |
| many:many | group meetings |

1:M synchronous with audio-video/broadcasting
- loudspeaker -> charismatic dictators (publci speakers)
- live TV -> looks/image
- Twitter -> short slogans
- _medium is the message_ - medium distorts the message
- same type of technology can result in different outcomes: charismatic dictators vs arab spring
	* -> ownership of technology is critical to impact
- cost:
	* synchronous tv broadcast expensive
	* webcasting drastically reduced cost

Drop in cost of technology often creates entrepreneurial opportunities
	- parentwatch.com webcasting daycare, samething for pets
	- education: distant learning

Asynchronous Education is even cheaper
- change education system to take advantage
- massive open online courses (MOOCs)
- _intelligent books_
- online education generally considered loewr quality
	- -> threatens lower level universities, but elitist universities may remain unaffected

| | benefits |
| - | - |
| asynchronous | anywhere/anytime/anyplace |
| synchronous | interaction |

Low Quality as a Competitive Strategy
- in technology business, lower quality and cheaper competition is a concern
	* with technologies that improve over time, low quality technologies can upgrade to mainstream, and high quality technologies become extravagant
- everyone's technology improves -> eventually the cheap option becomes good enough
	- high quality product may become less desirable, even at the same price
	- user experience - simple is better
- _disruptive technologies_ - often ignored by dominant firms as unprofitable
	- entry strategy, avoid competitive reaction, and slowly expand
- online education fits the model
- potential strategies to address these new entrants: ignore, buy out, direct competition

Optimum Design of Online Courses
- likely to become more of a production
- combination of synchronous & asynchronous
- parallel: music
- improvements: more interactivity, personal customization

Groupware and Consulting
- conerestone systems consulting co.: custom business software
-teams and client meetings via Cisco's Webex Conferencing
	- save time and money
	- place yourself closer to complex information and further from simpler information
- video not the most critical part; screensharing/document sharing extremely important
- _synchronous document sharing_: simultaneous viewing and editing of document by multiple users

Workflow Systems
- sequential document sharing, not synchronous, nor asynchronous
- automate supervision and control, electronically move documents & issue warnings
- e.g. paperwork

Managerial Implication of Control and Monitoring Tools
- use employee control and monitoring tools with care
- there is an optimum level of control to exercise
	- too little: no work done
	- too much: treating employees as robots doesn't take advantage of their skills

 Metcalfe’s Law, which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users
 - doesn't apply to Uber/Lyft
 - whoever has majority of drivers will slowly win
