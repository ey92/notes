# Introduction
- companies invest in IT to increase productivity
    - suggests capital to labor substitution
- **productivity** - output per employee per hour

## Productivity Paradox
**productivity paradox**: over 1975-1990, IT investment dramatically increasing, but productivity has been stagnant

### simple explanations:
1. measuring average productivity per employee (poor measurement)
    - some dramatically increase productivity while others' productivity drop
2. technology isn't used properly, can even be a distraction
3. time lag: delay in productivity increase
    1. training
    2. adapt tech for organization (customization), combined with secondary tech -> takes a long time
    3. adapt the organization to use IT (_business process engineering BPE_)

- optimal application of tech is between _ii_ and _iii_

e.g. electricity & redesigning factories ~ 40yrs
- estimating productivity delay is critical for high-tech companies
evidence: productivity shot up in 1990-1998, internet 2003-2016

### complex explanations:
1. time lag
    - evidence: time graph
2. misuse argument
    - for every business that uses IT properly gets a productivity increase, and two that don't
    - wasted effort -> no productivity, gains and losses cancel, average productivity doesn't change
    - may lead to more delay in productivity
    - also contributes to delay
        * companies that fail to integrate new technology take time to go out of business, which leads to increase of average productivity
    - evidence:
        - firm-level data
            * bimodal distribution of productivity
        - failures
            * 20% coporate IT projects fail within a year
            * more for startups and ecommerce
            * high variance suggests averages don't reflect productivity (self-reported is lower than actual failure)

investment into IT doesn't guarantee success

## Why is IT so complex?
Many techologies, and many tools for each

### Tool-Task Fit (Techology-Strategy Fit from organization perspective)
3 steps of fitting:
1. pick the right tool for the task
2. customize the tool for the task
3. reengineer the task for the tool
same reasons for delay in productivity

## Ecommerce is complex
Advantages
1. Reach: can reach more customers, over longer distances, at a lower cost, any time
    - lower customer acquisition cost
2. Richness: higher quality and complexity of information delivered to customers at lower cost
    - e.g. multimedia, customized product descriptions and recommendations
    - lower information deliver cost
3. Interactivity: form a stronger relationship with your customers
    - receive information back from your customers such as orders, reviews, preferences, and recommendations
    - lower information collection cost
    - #1-3 myths of electronic commerce
    - valid potential advantages, but very difficult to utilize
    - success in any 3 is rare
4. Ubiquity
    - consumers expend extra effort to reach traditional marketplace
    - marketspace is removed from temporal or geographic location
    - reduces transaction costs - cost of participating in market
    - reduces cognitive energy/mental effort to shop
5. Universal Standards
    - technical standards are universal
    - traditional commerce technology differs in each country
    - lower market entry costs (selling products)
    - lower search costs (finding products)
    - _price discovery_ faster, more accurate, easy to compare
6. Information Density
    - ecommerce tech reduces cost of
        - information collection
        - information storage
        - information processing
        - communication
    - increase currency, accuracy, timeliness of information
    - information is plentiful, cheaper, higher quality
    - price transparency, cost transparency
    - merchants can segment market, allowing for
        - price discrimination
        - cater to consumer preferences
7. Personalization/Customization
    - _customization_ - changing the delivered product or service based on a user's preferences or prior behavior
        - past purchases
        - browsing history
8. Social Technology
    - many-to-many model of mass communications
    - create, edit, and distribute content
    - social shopping and reputation

## Amazon
- successful in advantages 1-3
profitable?
- finally started making money in 2015-2016
- lost $1B over revenues of $3B in 2001
    - spent the money on advertisement
### transformation
books -> department store -> mall -> software and cloud services -> hardware: tablets -> streaming & content provider -> logistics & warehousing -> delivery -> grocery

- Amazon vs. Stone Soup in 1999
    * created a platform for selling items without providing any of the content
    * _intermediaries_ - facilitators of transactions between buyers and sellers
    * no physical processing, inventory, books, buildings, or significant physical existence
    * _infomediaries_ - intermediaries with no significant physical existence

## Constant Change as a Business Strategy
Why is constant change a good strategy good for IT business?
e.g. Google -> automobiles; Uber -> trucking; Apple -> music
1. Ease of Imitation
    - to prevent competitors from imitating, you create an arms race of technologies
    constantly build up on the lead that you hve
    e.g. Snapchat, iPhone, Bitcoin
2. Synergies between Technologies
    - there are shared components among many technologies
    - one the shared component is in place, expanding into new areas is cheap with high returns
    e.g. cloud computing by Google and Amazon, ebay & payment
3. Substitutability of Technologies
    - threats can come from anywhere, because there s substitutability among technologies
    - Google Search threatened by Facebook; search vs. social networks
    - "social shopping"
4. Fast-Changing Technology Environment
    - there is a fast-changing high tech environment
    - easy to become irrelevant quickly
    - similar problem with social institutions
        e.g. law, religion, government, education, family are designed to be rigid and inflexible
    - virtual instutions can explore the possibility of designing more flexible institutions using technology

## Impact of IT
- intense in 2 areas
- _intermediation_ - bringing buyers and sellers together to facilitate exchange of goods and services
    * _organizing_ and _coordinating_ efforts to produce goods and services
- _management_:setting goals, communicating goals, coordinating efforts to achieve the goals
- information intensive jobs require extensive communication and information processing
- IT is designed to support communication and information processing

## 2 Hypotheses
1. IT is the tool of trade for managers and ofen lead to new forms and styles of management
2. IT is a significant tool for intermediaries, and often leads to new types of intermediation
Questions: 
- What does IT do for managers and intermediaries?
- How can they adapt the technology to create a better fit for the organization?
- How do managers and intermediaries change themselves to take advantage of the technologies optimally?


# Communication and Conferencing, Virtual Corporation
- communication technologies provide simple examples for several complex concepts
    -tool-taks  fit, business processs reengineering
        * webcasting and conferencing: consulting, education
    - impact of IT on management
        * doc sharing, coordination
    - impact of IT on intermediaries

## Classification
- criteria: mode, content, scope

| _mode_ | example |
| - | - |
| synchronous | call |
| asynchronous | email (stored for your convenience) |

_content_: text, graphics, audio, video

| _scope_ | example |
| - | - |
| 1:1 | call, mail |
| 1:many | lecture, books/publications, web pages |
| many:1 | web transactions, mailboxes |
| many:many | group meetings |

#### 1:M synchronous with audio-video/broadcasting
- loudspeaker -> charismatic dictators (publci speakers)
- live TV -> looks/image
- Twitter -> short slogans
- _medium is the message_ - medium distorts the message
- same type of technology can result in different outcomes: charismatic dictators vs arab spring
    * -> ownership of technology is critical to impact
- cost:
    * synchronous tv broadcast expensive
    * webcasting drastically reduced cost

#### Drop in cost of technology often creates entrepreneurial opportunities
- parentwatch.com webcasting daycare, samething for pets
- education: distant learning

#### Asynchronous Education is even cheaper
- change education system to take advantage
- massive open online courses (MOOCs)
- _intelligent books_
- online education generally considered loewr quality
    - -> threatens lower level universities, but elitist universities may remain unaffected

| | benefits |
| - | - |
| asynchronous | anywhere/anytime/anyplace |
| synchronous | interaction |

#### Low Quality as a Competitive Strategy
- in technology business, lower quality and cheaper competition is a concern
    * with technologies that improve over time, low quality technologies can upgrade to mainstream, and high quality technologies become extravagant
- everyone's technology improves -> eventually the cheap option becomes good enough
    - high quality product may become less desirable, even at the same price
    - user experience - simple is better
- _disruptive technologies_ - often ignored by dominant firms as unprofitable
    - entry strategy, avoid competitive reaction, and slowly expand
- online education fits the model
- potential strategies to address these new entrants: ignore, buy out, direct competition

#### Optimum Design of Online Courses
- likely to become more of a production
- combination of synchronous & asynchronous
- parallel: music
- improvements: more interactivity, personal customization

#### Groupware and Consulting
- conerestone systems consulting co.: custom business software
-teams and client meetings via Cisco's Webex Conferencing
    - save time and money
    - place yourself closer to complex information and further from simpler information
- video not the most critical part; screensharing/document sharing extremely important
- _synchronous document sharing_: simultaneous viewing and editing of document by multiple users

#### Workflow Systems
- sequential document sharing, not synchronous, nor asynchronous
- automate supervision and control, electronically move documents & issue warnings
- e.g. paperwork

#### Managerial Implication of Control and Monitoring Tools
- use employee control and monitoring tools with care
- there is an optimum level of control to exercise
    - too little: no work done
    - too much: treating employees as robots doesn't take advantage of their skills

# Networks
**Metcalfe’s Law**, which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users
- doesn't apply to Uber/Lyft
- whoever has majority of drivers will slowly win

 # Networks
 **Protocols** - rules of navigating and sharing networks

- HTTP aka WWW, supports 1:M asynchronous communication
    - views wolrd as collection of docuents, each with address
    - address -> document
    - hypertext: text can be linked to more docmuents (nonlinear sequence of documents)
- email, telnet, FTP

### HTTP
- TCP
- IP: addressing
- client-server
- multiple layers bc developed at different times and served different purposes/"multi-purpose components"
- technologies change incrementally, allowing managers to anticipate if they know what to watch and follow the development
- technologies take a long time todevelop, commercialize, and even longer before widespread adoption

- 1948 Vannevar Bush: concept of WWW 1948 called Memex, manual system
- 1980s UMinnesota: Gopher, failed because no links, text-only, no GUI
- extremely expensive to maintain
- cost-based pricing too expensive in the beginning, incentivizes people to wait for cheaper price, no early users
- value-based pricing

### Network effects
- typical of networking and communication technologies
- product has positive network effects if the value of a product to a user increases with the total number of users (e.g. fax machine)
- value grows quadratically with number of users n^2^
- adds another cause for delay in adoption of technologies **in A1**
    - value of product is low in the beginning (before network is built)
- fax machine invented 1843, adopted in 1980s; 1st email 1969
- most companies can't afford long wait for return on investment
- *strategies to reduce delay:
    - free giveaways or introductory pricing
    - Tim Berners Lee invented WWW 1991 and gave it away for free because inferior product, inefficient, unreliable
- value-based dynamic pricing: multi-period analysis is necessary for the life of the product when there are network effects, because the price today effects the demand in the future
- consumers psychologically require stable price
- critical price point: free to charged
    - NY Times Online and 99c/month subscription fee
- bundling with an established product
    - e.g. IE, audio/video conferencing
- Google: search engine with learning algorithm: searchers
- _weak network effect_:
    - _fashion effect_ - fashion and reputation have weak network effects if they make your product more valuable
    - _watercooler effect_ - sharing/discussing the same content
    - _two-sided/indirect network effect_
        - online magazine: more readers -> attract better writers
        - Uber: drivers/riders
        - MS Windows: applications/users
        - Amazon: buyers/sellers
- if you need to exchange documents, likely to have network effects
- _economies of scale are not network effects, because they relate to cost, not value of the product_
- **first mover advantages** - once you achieve a critical mass, product is more valuable than competitors' products who are just starting to build their network
    - sustainable competitive advantage from size
- linear vs quadratic adoption rate
    - fatal implications:
        - overestimate demand in beginning (overproduction)
        - underestimate demand later (underproduction)
    - Corning Glass fiber optic 1990s almost failed until internet videos
    - railways in England 1800s: grew 20% annually, but traffic grew 4%; 1850s: railways grew 4%, traffic grew 20%
    - NY canal system 1880s
    - _Economist_: technological success but financial failure

# Databases and Electronic Markets
## Information Storage
Problems with Storage:

1. Dynamic Information: text documents difficult to update
2. Large Quantity: text documents waste space
3. Search and Filter: text documents are difficult to search
- complex questions
    - e.g. card holders w/ past due balances
    - e.g. purchsed camera in last month
    - e.g. cards used only when travel

- **fundamental problem**: accessibility
- inccessible -> difficult to use and analyze data

## Databases
store, search, retrieve, and update data efficiently
- every dept can collect and use own data

### Local vs. Shared Data
#### 1. decentralized and disconnected: duplicate storage in multiple databases
- multiple databases, redundancy
- issues:
    - redundancy, slow, _potential inconsistencies_

#### 2. decentralized and connected: store data where created and provide remote access
- multiple databases, no redundancy
- issues: 
- incompatibility between multiple databases
    - semantic: naming & unit conventions

#### 3. centralized but distributed: single organizational database
- centrally controlled pool of data with no redundancy or incompatibility
- can be geographically distributed
- _Data Model_ single central plan
- issues:
    - size problem/information overload: software solution
    - difficult to design single central plan for organization -> Database Management System (DBMS)
    - management problem: shared resources have to be managed and lead a political problems -> Database Administrator (DBA)

### Business Applications:
---
#### 1. Tracking Resources: transactions, inventory, organizational performance, processes and workflow systems
- freed _accounting_ from bookkeping via automation
- _transactions_ on same document (ordering, shipping, delivery)
- _inventory_ connected to registers, trigger reorder when supply below threshold
- _organizational performance_ manager can bypass line of command and get his own information from the database
    - information inconsistency vs overload -> stream the right level of information to corresponding level of management
- _traders_ filter & aggregate analysts' advice from database
- processes and **workflow systems** (systems that track processes): **concurrency**

#### Braess Paradox
network effects complicate centralization/decentralization debate further and require even more centralization to reach the global optimum

Leads to **Negative Network Effects**
1. centralize decisions
2. new technology can make everyone worse off, although each person will be better off

- When there are network effects, need to cooperate and centralize decisions -> industry standards and platforms; cooperation allows better outcomes

#### 2. 
#### 3.
#### 4.
#### 5.

## Web Retailers
earliest retailers: books computers, travel, brokerages
    - formally defined and information intensive products -> require extensive search
### Electronic Catalogs
- Sears
- advantages vs paper catalogs
    - cheaper - print & delivery, updates
    - easier to search, DBMS provides structure and language for search
- disadvantages vs physical stores
    - touch/feel products before buying
        - free returns or request detailed measurements
    - need web access
- most appropriate for fast-changing databases
- e.g. online stock trading, flight schedule, search engines
    - web crawlers, search engine optimization, spamming is possible with invisible keywords or manually submit keywords to search engines
- Physical stores have inventory, web stores have lower price
    - **free rider problem**: benefit from a good or service without payment because of lack of a market
    - web stores take advantage of services provided by physical stores; e.g. look at Best Buy, buy on Amazon

#### Potential Solutions
1. Physical stores also sell on internet, but doesn't reduce rent costs
    - charge less online -> lose own customers
    - charge same price -> lose customers to competitors
    - Web store as separate business - loses brand name
2. Charge for free service
    - car dealers lobbied lawmakers to require cars to be sold via dealers and not manufacturers
3. Add on services that online competitors couldn't provide (actual solution)
    - bookstores (community events, booksigning, cafe), furniture (interior design, delivery,  used furniture marketplace, repairs, cleaning), brokerage

**Most successful solution creates synergy between online and physical store**
- larger inventory online
- physical stores allow interaction with product but don't have to deliver
- buy online, pick up at store

Google as competition with Amazon
- collaborate with local stores: take dynamic inventory of small stores and connect with search engine capabilities to allow for quick delivery

### Direct Marketing
- result of database technology, directed at individuals at specific point in time
- keep track of individuals' purchases, allowing future purchase forecasting
- predict behavior via _profiling_ using demographic data and past purchases

### Relationship Marketing
- tracking customers over time and adjust to their changing needs
- database tech made tracking customers possible
- acquiring new customer 4x as expensive as tracking and keeping old customer
- **Hunter-Gather Paradigm of Marketing**: search for customers, locate them, sell, move on
- **Agrarian (Farming) Paradigm of Marketing**: cultivate customers, watch & grow over time, educate, anticipate needs, shape and create needs, protect and reward
- relationship marketing on the web necessary to compensate for lack of physical location or quality
- easier by tracking customer and not just their purchases
- cookies, identify information placed on customers' computers, determine when they come back and where they have been

### Location-Based Commerce
- tracking in the physical world
- track path with wireless transmitters and sensors, recommends products as you pass them
- **Location-Based Commerce**

### Gamification
- influence process of buying
- convert shopping process into game - **gamification**
- reveals information about customer and what is important to them, how much effort they are willing to put in

## Inter-organizational Systems/EDI/B2B SYstems
- Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) - inter-organizational systems on private networks
- B-B systems (business-to-business systems) - inter-organizational systems on public networks

organizational db deliver data to whole organization from a single source
- extend idea to multiple organizations

EDI allows entering transaction only once transaction is initiated
EDI: database to database communication of business transactions through db-web-db connection
- if encrypted and automatically commnicated to multiple databases for enhanced trust, called **blockchain**

advantages:
- reduce errors, inconsistencies, delays
- track resources in other organization
- concurrent task execution

?-db-web-dbb-?
- link transaction to internal systems at either end
e.g. link supplier and retailer
retailer: inventory control, automatic reorder systems
supplier: production-distribution systems

e-business

### Supplier Managed Inventory
- supplier acess internal systems of retailer
- Walmart-Proctor&Gamble alliance (retail link system)
    - P&G sales forecasts from Wal-Mart directly and in real time and adjusts production and distribution schedules
    - _just-in-time delivery_: minimize inventory to reduce cost but still get profits
- Dell-Intel alliance (e2open System)
- Colombia Drug Cartels
- Cisco Systems
    - business customers access Cisco's internal systems to configure networks, check for accuracy, completeness, price
     $3M investment, 800% ROI 1st yr, error rates dropped 30% - 0.3%

### Support Virtual Organizations/Virtual Corporations
- customization and tracking
    - e.g. students take courses at other schools
- resource sharing/specialization
    - e.g. course level competition
    - granularity of competition at course level, not just universities
- outsourcing and (becoming) virtual organization
    - e.g. eliminate unsuccessful courses and focus on core areas
- process improvement using big data
    - e.g. allow comparison data such as effectiveness

### Sharing Economy/Mom-tech
- virtualization allows resource sharing among individuals
    - uber, flycleaners, handy, blue apron, etc...
- social institutions
    - families mix and match services offered by others (customization and tracking)
    - specializing in tasks
    - outsource tasks
    - process improvement

### Supply Chain Integration
- chain of EDI connections support supply chain: retailer, distributor, wholesaler, manufacturer, parts supplier, parts manufacturer
- speed communication, reduce errors and inconsistencies
- perishable goods: grocery, fashion
- channel time from design to sale: 2010-36days, 2016-16days

### Problems
- 4 organizational issues

#### 1. Technical Complexity and Outsourcing
- make internal systems of every company compatible with each other's databases and internal systems
- building web infrastructure can be serious risk for older established companies
- **outsourcing complexity** with FedEx
    - FedEx + caliber logistics = virtual order
    - virtual order system is complete integrated logistics solution to physical logistics, information logistics, and payments
    - what is left?
- _be careful with outsourcing_ - no business left when everything is outsourced
    - keep core competence
- FedEx gets Silicon Valley Division of Texas Instruments - ideal client for virtual order
    - controlling entire supply chain is even better
- outsourcing complexity almost always reduce costs, but not long-term competitive advantage
     - competitors can also outsource
     - allows easy entry
    - _complexity creates barriers to entry_ - can become its own competitive advantage if done well

##### when to outsource complexity?
**market share vs market size** tradeoff
- outsourcing & industry standards causes costs and prices to go down
    - customers benefit, market expands
    - each individual has very small share of market (no competitive advantage)
- with most technologies, smaller share of larger market is often more desirable
    - -> outsourcing complexity pays off
    - network effects - size of market increases value of product
- Rule of Thumb: unless technology like EDI is your competitive advantage, you should support industry standards and outsource
- MS vs Apple over PC
    - Windows kept OS in-house & outsource hardware + software
    - Apple kept everything in-house
    - MS managed to build huge market & split with Intel, Dell, etc...
    - Apple built small market but kept all of it
- Google vs Apple over mobile
    - same strategies but Apple outsourced applications (network effects)

#### 2. Privacy
- retailer knows customers better than they know themselves
    - know competitors
- Amazon in 2002 shipped books only from Ingram Book Co.
    - keep customer information & relationship (brand recognition expensive)
    - advantage can easily be bypassed by stealing customers
- Ingram tried to have B&N buy them, stopped by US Govt (antitrust/vertical integration)
- privacy may prevent efficiency in the supply chain

- difference from Walmart/P&G
    - Walmart owns distribution (physical locations)
    - P&G is producer
    - Amazon only has customer information
    - Ingram has distribution

#### 3. Ownership and Lock In
- system to system coupling requires compatibility, expensive
    - Google merge local inventory
    - GE subsidizes suppliers' compatible systems
- **Lock In**: switching costs
- independent B2B markets
    - high potential
    - slow to establish - easy to fail (_network effects_)
- **Market Ownership**
    - network effect solution 1: can't be free bc compatibility expensive to build
        - B2B market has no value until integration issues are resolved 
    - network effect solution 2: need large players to build critical mass quickly
        - but they prefer to own the marketplace
    - big players monopoly/oligopoly collude, fix prices, manipulate demand; exploit small players
- _network effects + switching costs lead to monopolies_
    - network effects: can't get new customers
    - switching costs: can't steal customers
    - 1st mover advantage - need to be the first to build a critical mass
    - cooperate competitors and build industry standards, have a small slice of big market

#### 4. BPR
- EDI allows inter-firm coordination
- organizational processes have to be redesigned to take full advantage of inter-firm coordination
    - individual companies' systems are optimized for their specialties
- P&G/Walmart
    - eliminate backroom operations
    - P&G prepackage products to be placed on shelf
    - _supplier managed shelf space_
- Netflix's DVD business
    - don't re-shelf DVD
    - send it to the person who wants it next
    - need system to match DVDs with addresses
- UPS/HP
    - manufacturer -> UPS -> HP -> retailer
    - everything is delivered twice: combine assembly/delivery
    - assemble computers while parts are waiting during transport layover - moved assembly operations to airport hangar
    - cut $80 and 4 days
- BPR creates new business models in 3 steps
    - 1. networking and automated search (Netflix)
    - 2. resources sharing (HP)
    - 3. disintermediation (Walmart)
- 2 industry examples
    - taxi industry:
        - 1. Uber
        - 2. carpooling/car sharing
        - 3. community share cars (no driver)
    - music industry:
        - 1. download (iTunes)
        - 2. stream (YouTube/Spotify)
        - 3. ? match artist to consumers

### Information Logistics
database is warehouse, web is transportation
- 3 tools
    - Data Model: describe contents of database
    - Query Language: filter and retrieve data
    - Data Page: transport data from database to web users

#### Data Model
- central plan that describes contents of database
- **relational model** represents data in simple tables
- Table (File, Relation) for each entity type (flights)
- Row (Entity, Record) for each entity of a type (flight)
- Column (Attribute, Field) each attribute of interest for entity type
- Fill (Value)
<br><br>
- simplicity of model belies complexity underneath
- tables are not stored as tables
- extremely large - doesn't fit in RAM/hard drive too slow
- DBMS create and maintain data structures e.g. indices, catalogues
<br><br>
- database design involves defining data needs of organization in form of tables
- tables/relations have to be designed carefully to avoid duplication
    - redundancy -> wastes space, difficult maintenance, inconsistencies
- trivial redundancies: don't duplicate rows or columns
- some redundancies very subtle
- some redundancies are unavoidable
- split into another table
- design rule: put independent entity type in separate table
- same entity type over multiple tables introduces unnecessary jumping table to table

#### Query Languages & Queries
- query languages simple enough for user to interact with database without programmers
- SQL Structured (English) Query Language, industry standard for RDBMS
    - complete ( can access any information stored in the database)
```
SELECT  column names
FROM    table name
WHERE   condition to select rows
NOT IN  negative query
*
<>
DISTINCT
```
single-table
```
select flightno, destination
from flight
where origin='ny'
```
```
select distinct origin
from flight
```
multi-table
- convention: tablename.column
```
select flight.flightno
from flight, schedule, passenger
where flight.origin='ny'
    and flight.destination='chicago'
    and flight.price < 300
    and flight.flightno=schedule.flightno   // join condition
    and schedule.dtime < 900
    and flight.flightno = passenger.flightno    // join condition
    and passenger.name='Jones'
```
```
select flight.flightno
from flight
where flight.flightno not in (select passenger.flightno from passenger)
```
- _join condition_
    - jumping from table to another, carry condition
- inner query in parentheses
    - inner query evaluated first

#### Data Pages
3 tools:
- static data page (data on a web page)
- dynamic data page (automatically updated)
- interactive data page (customized)

Static Data Page
- manually carry response from query to web page
- cheap
- use when data doesn't change quickly
- limited use - takes work to update
- flights.html
db ---create page---> server (flights.html/data) <---request--- browser <--- request
                                                  ---deliver--- 

Dynamic Data Page
- flightd.aspx
- Active Server Page with XML
- more complex and expensive
- data is cached & need to refresh page/send another query when database is updated
- web page contains a program, not text (query)
update ---> db <---run query--- server (flightd.aspx/query) <---request--- browser <--- request
                --create page-->                             ---deliver--- 

Interactive Data Page
- necessarily dynamic data page + parametric queries
    - can't run query until received parameters from user
- flighti.aspx
- use forms to collect parameter values from users

## Multimedia
#### 1. text links
- text links (hyperlinks) to text, images, A/V, programs, links to other pages
- video on demand
- YouTube, Esquire, Amazon
- big data with video
    - index video segments to make them searchable, SPORTVU
- tagging and searching video segments
- feature films on demand: Netflix, Amazon, etc.
- DVD business - historical inertia: watching movie on big screen, poor network connection
- economics of online video:
    - broadcast TV: 0 marginal cost for digital products
    - on-demand online video: constant
- 5 Mbs x 10M watchers = 50Tbs = entire internet capacity
- _multicasting_: send one copy to a locality and distributing to all from there, but requests not synchronized
    - protocol (automatic), Akamai
- 2 solutions:
    - download ahead batch the requests to a locality
    - redundant permanent local storage
    - optimum is mix
- distribution of information is underestimated 
    - process is _similar to distribution of physical goods_
    - same strategies

#### 2. Dynamic Documents/Drill Down Documents
- dynamic documents link text to database
- [text -> db ->> text]
- automatically generate output text
- each step is easily manageable
- choices at each step narrow down the choices available in the next step
- reduce information processing by user
- Sabre was first airline reservations system (now Travelocity)
    - AA owns online flight reservation system market
    - control listings - AA flights show up first
    - see other airlines' transactions
- airlines tried to cooperate - Orbitz, sold to Expedia

#### 3. Drill Down reports (Executive Information Systems EIS)
- text -> db ->> stats, graphs ->> text, images
- reports contain derived data: processed, aggregated, summarized, analyzed
- drill down reports are characterized by repetitive queries
- how to provide information to top executives
- 4 characteristics:
    - _highly processed graphical_ output on dashboards (stats, graphs)
    - small chunks of information at each step, with a _drill down_
    - both the dashboard and the drill down are _personalized_
    - dynamic documents with up-to-date _real time_ information
- MIDS of Lockheed Martin (Management INformation and Decision Support)
    - 1000 _graphic_ displays as dashboards
    - each _personalized_ to meet the specific needs of an individual in real time
    - each _drill down_ capability into detailed _real time_ data
    - pushed to each executive's deck every morning
    - Bank One
- EIS leads to new stiles of management
    - allows more delegating, only deal with exception
- Google Analytics dashboard monitors effectiveness of website

#### 4. Image Links
- links from images to other documents

#### 5. Image Maps
- [image -> text, image]
- image maps from image to image repetitively
- Charts and and Maps
- Training
- table top computing w/ touch-sensitive screens (MS)
- potential to change restaurant, bar, library experiences

#### 6. Animation
- [image ->> image]
- browsing through series of images
- GIF animator by MS, ANFY animation library, Devolver animation tools
- full range human motion, full facial emotion
- Disney/Pixar, Dreamworks/Spielberg
- vision: replace acting with automated animations?

#### 7. Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- [image -> db ->> text,image]
- demographics overlaid on maps
- manipulating images of complex natural phenomena

#### 8. Visualization Systems
- [image -> db ->> stats,graph,simulation ->> text, image]
- similar to GIS but repeatedly manipulate graphics
- visualize complex multivariable relationships

#### 9. Virtual Reality
- direct manipulation of visual models in 3D
- main applications product design, architecture, gaming, increasingly finance
- Oculus, Sony
- goggles/gloves are inconvenient

#### 10. Gesture Recognition (VR)
- accomplish VR-like interaction without gloves
- Leap motion device via sensors
- might make touch sensitive screens obsolete
    - advantage: more expressive than touch (3D vs 2D)
- Thalmic Labs Myo Armband, wear sleeve around wrist & detect muscle movement, communicated with wireless receiver
- Google Soli gesture recognition via Radar

#### 11. Augmented Reality (VR superimposed on physical world)
- add physical objects
- see virtual images in a physical context
- maintains relationship as you move around or manipulate the virtual image
- MS virtual presence

#### 12. Audio/Video Links
- audio,video -> text, images
- experimentation with sports events, interactive news
- difficult to click on a running video
- classic example sports
- IBM China superimpose pop-up videos on top of a running video, called hot video or clickable video
    - add data to video content, allow hyperlink to content
- Walmart bought Vudu to insert ads into online video
- Facebook made deal with Warner Brothers to make movies available for rent from within Facebook page; all Facebook functions will be integrated with the movie
- Cornell Tech URU superimpose ads on surfaces within videos

#### 13. Audio-Video DB Links
- audio, video -> DB -> text, images
- sports events, interactive news, with database access and statistical information
- online polling with real time results during political events
- audio input into Sears auto mechanic training system; easier, cheaper than AR
    - audio input - voice command

#### 14. Video control
- video -> video
- surround video: 350 degree video of 3D objects
- Ipix combines 2D pictures into a 3D surround video
    - 360 degree panoramic-lens camera directly produces surround video
- 306fly camera
- 360 degree pictures of roadways, create 3D maps, maybe may insides of buildings
- add AR on top of maps or even physical world with directions and location information without headset via laser projection

#### 15. Video Tours
- collections of video clips with dynamic controls over the sequence of clips
- interactive broadcasting of sports events
- DVRs and tivo, replaytv, ultimatetv do some, but don't change angles and views
- 2 ways to make interactive video watching
    - make TV more like web with storage device
    - make web more like TV with interactive video
- interactivity can be useful in creating customized experience in all performances
- interactive movies are feature films customized by real-time audience feedback

## Digital Products
- web is a medium to deliver information
- web businesses maximize information delivery as opposed to physical products
- information as product is ideal for the web: digital products
    - education, business data, publishing (music, films), broadcasting (TV), software

## 5 Organizational Issues (Analysis of) with Digital Products
1. Quality and Electronic Distribution
2. Copyright ans Sharing
3. Customization and Interactivity
4. Communities
5. Price Discrimination

### 1. Quality Problem and Multimedia Delivery
- high quality products expensive to produce
- likely to combine text, audio/video, animations, interactivity in one platform; blurs distinction between all types of media
- e.g. Apple iBook (Alice in Wonderland)
- Spritz designs ebooks by completely re-engineering the process of reading
    - don't move eyes, but move the text
    - "double" reading speed
- electronic books vs physical books
    - cheaper distribution for ebooks
    - physical distribution very expensive
- Ingram: electronic distribution is advantage, not online reading
    - distribute physical books electronically
        - electronic distribution by Lightningsource with Espresso Book Machine - print and bind 300-page book in 4 minutes
        - place machines at bookstores
        - download and print books in bookstore as you wait
    - advantage to bookstore: no inventory (bookstore with no inventory)
        - concern for bookstore: bookstore becomes a printing booth, not a bookstore (too much outsourcing)
    - hesitant to proceed - possible retaliation by bookstores
    - **channel conflict**: multiple channels of distribution undermining each other
- channel conflict also reason why automobile companies do not sell cars online

#### Electronic Distribution to Improve Quality
- digital distribution applies to all digital products
- deliver to consumer device other than an computer to improve quality of UX
- interesting new business models (e.g. music/phones, movies/TVs)
- Walmart embraced video downloading to DVDs instead of fighting it
    - create synergies between physical stores and video downloading to DVDs
    - in-store kiosks to download video and burn onto DVDs
    - advantages vs on downloading on PC: having high-internet speed, computer, video quality
    - creates foot traffic at Walmart with possible cross-selling

### 2. Copyright Problem
- once you give away an electronic copy of product, easy to duplicate or resell
- dominated music industry for past 15 years
- 3 types of solutions: legal, technical, economic

#### Legal Solution
- music industry vs file-sharing businesses such as Napster, Kazaa, Morpheus, Aimster, Pirate Bay, BitTorrent, Megaupload
- **separability test**: Napster case established by the courts that the separability of legal and illegal uses requires sharing sites to block illegal uses
    - original Napster satisfied separability test (central database of files, but didn't block illegal uses), but shut down
    - modern sites use distributed strategy (peer-to-peer network)
        - less efficient file-sharing and distribution
        - less vulnerable legally
        - creators don't know how filesharing site is used (_plausible deniability_)

#### Technical Solution
- watermarking and tracking
- Playboy Corp: use watermarks and doing a web search/crawlers
- heavy use of hyperlinks to discourage mass copying
    - media is downloaded one chunk at a time - mass copying is difficult
- streaming media - don't download media
    - program displays media, but no local file to share
- screen scraping programs can copy anything displayed on your monitor
    - not effective with technically savvy users
- historically, streaming audio reduced the need to own music (radio)
    - internet radio for streaming music can be customized
    - interactive radio - audio on demand - no need for file sharing

#### Economic Solution
- sharing of digital products does not necessarily harm the sellers for 3 reasons:

##### 1. _savings from digital distribution_
- when distribution and marketing costs are high, cost savings from digital distribution can compensate more than enough for losses from sharing
- readers, authors, publishers earn more from digital distribution
- comedian Louis CK - bypassing cable networks and distributing his own shows on the web; allow people to share them

##### 2. _sharing leads to market expansion_
- when untapped potential market is very large, and advertising and customer acquisition costs are high, sharing by consumers may expand the market and benefit everyone
- unknown new bands are supportive of music sharing
- revenue = market size x market share of paying customers
    - _pays to have a smaller share of a larger market_
- 1980s movie producers vs VCR technology
    - benefited movie producers by creating new market of home entertainment in 1990s
- 1800s public libraries vs book publishers
    - public libraries made reading popular
    - reading was previously an elite hobby
    - massive growth of market size

##### 3. _sharing may lead to monopolistic prices_
- sharing can benefit sellers, if they can control prices and price better
- _monopolistic competition_: information sellers often have freedom to set prices because digital products are unique to each seller
- if you know the product will be shared, you price it higher
    - **site license**: one price, multiple distribution
    - e.g. MS Office sells to university for 50k
        - save on advertising and distribution
    - publishers through library rates: software companies though site sharing
- economic analysis of sharing is complex
    - sharing does not always benefit sellers
    - example assuming marginal production cost is 0:
        - reservation price of 4 customers: 1   3   3   4
        - revenues for price: 1,3,4:        4   9   9   4
        - maximum revenue:                              9
        - \-
        - 2 sites of customers:             1+4=5   3+3=6
        - revenues at price 5,6:                10       6
        - maximum revenue:                              10
        - \-
        - 2 sites of customers:             1+3=4   3+4=7
        - revenues at price 4,7:                8       7
        - maximum revenue:                              8
- when do suppliers benefit from sharing?
    - distribution of reservation prices: normal distribution
    - when people share, distribution will have a smaller variance (from Central Limit Theorem)
        - sharing ~ sampling: sharing may reduce variance in reservation prices (less market uncertainty)
        - can price better and capture more of the market
    - sharing doesn't always decrease variance; sometimes sharing increases variance
        - if sample not always the same size, variance can go up
        - if populations relatively uniform in size with similar reservation prices from CLT, variance will go down
        - if populations are not uniform in size or reservation prices, variance may increase
        - more importantly, can still benefit if can charge different prices for each population
            - **price discrimination**
- thought experiment: no copyright protection
    - nobody would create anything, since they can't sell enough copies to overcome production costs
        - assumes few sellers, fixed prices
    - what if you set the price very high, knowing it would be shared?
        - very few people would buy
        - early buyers will be resellers to make the money back (no copyright protection); can also make money if they judge product's value correctly
        - in a highly networked environment with peer-to-peer market places, where people can distribute and sell to each other via YouTube and Ebay, no copyright protection could lead to vibrant marketplace
        - may be more efficient marketplace without a mass market or mass advertising
    - alternative market environment may actually be a very successful marketplace, but not tried yet

![Distribution of Reservation Prices](https://github.com/ey92/notes/blob/master/distribution-of-reservation-prices.png)

### 3. Customization
- growing importance in marketing
- digital products
    - initial development cost high
    - marginal cost is 0
    - price goes down to 0 -> market disappears
    - leads to customization (monopolistic competition)
- customization is not easy
    - require information
    - maintain a large and varied inventory (resolved with databases)
        - became a competitive advantage
    - match products to individual customer needs and informing of the match
        - a few popular products tend to dominate the market
        - musicians, blogs, dominate market, resulting in winner-take-all markets
        - technology to fix problem is _recommendation system_
            - simple recommendation systems make matters worse
            - creates winner-take-all environments
- customization can expand the market

#### Customized Recommendations
- identify different types of customers
- create many niche markets, no single product should dominate market
- **long tail phenomenon** many niche markets can collectively add up to a larger market than the few popular products
- most popular products are not a good match for everyone
- statistical analysis focuses too much on the average and expected, not enough emphasis on the unusual and unexpected
- if new or rare event, statistics are useless
- requires and orderly world where the past can predict the future
- rare events now dominate our lives due to technology
- high-tech, fast-changing world

### 4. Web Communities
- web communities: ongoing relationships among group of people with common interest to exchange information, experiences, advice
- mass advertising by sellers, as it is typically done, is claimed to be a fundamentally faulty model
- commercial communities of interest provide alternative
- community of enthusiasts and owners is the best place to get advice for purchasing something
- future of advertising where communities of buyers and sellers interact as equals, rather than information asymmetry
    - **information symmetry** - sellers with superior knowledge dominating the buyers with limited knowledge

### 5. Price Discrimination
- buyers pay maximum reservation price
- _who_ values products differently
    - _differential value_: personal characteristics (preferences)
    - _conditional value_: ownership characteristics (depends on what you already own)
    - pricing strategy: upgrade fees less than new purchases
    - use **freemium model**
        - addictive goods
        - experience goods - learn more about the product, becomes more valuable
    - American Airlines vs People Express (discount airline)
        - Saber reservation system
        - customer buying habits -> price discrimination
        - overprice schedule-based plans and underprice customers with looser schedule
    - **incompatibility and lock in**
        - loyalty programs
        - GM credit card - lock in to GM products & gain customer information
        - give discount to people with lower reservation prices
    - **lock in program**
        - avoid direct competition by locking in customers
        - loyalty programs rarely benefit customers; collect points -> locked in
        - once you're locked in, raise the price
- determine _what_ value is
    - approximate substitutes
    - **artificially change prices** & observe reaction to price changes
        - shopping cards allow observing customer's reaction to price changes
    - **follow path of customer** through website
    - **set up an auction**
        - when do customers stop bidding? know their reservation prices
- _how_ to charge buyer that determined value
    - charge reservation prices
    - 1850s railroads mistreated 3rd class passengers
        - encourage anyone with money to buy 2nd class passengers
    - difficult in physical stores but easier in virtual stores to show different prices for each customer
        - WaPo 2016 experiment: clearing cookies gave lower average price
    - caveat: legal issues basis of race, gender, age, handicap

# Security, Integrity, Privacy
- **security**: preventing loss or destruction of resources
- **integrity**: ensuring correctness of information
- **privacy**: limiting access to information

## Security
#### 1. Destruction of Resources
- viruses, worms, natural disasters
- virus are attached to documents
    - take advantage of the fact that people are constantly exchanging documents
    - must click to be activated
- worms travel on their own
    - take advantage of the fact that servers are constantly talking to each other (protocols)
    - travel from server to server
    - travel on their own
    - Stuxnet (2010) Iranian nuclear facilities
    - hard to detect
- cyber warfare is changing the nature of warfare
    - infrastructure is based on computers
    - wars will start with cyber warfare - knock out command/control center
    - 1st Iraqi war
- solution: virus protection software
- backup of critical resources

#### 2. Theft of Resources
- unauthorized transfers of money, stealing credit card numbers, or bank account numbers with spyware, unauthorized use of computers to send spam mail or pop-up ads
- credit card insurance company loses when this happens (customers not liable)
    - don't always cover costs
    - fraud rates are twice as high as physical commerce
    - so high that many sellers don't accept international orders
        - counters global reach advantage of ecommerce
    - credit card companies and insurance companies only cover the loss when there is a paper receipt and signature
        - if not, merchant stuck with loss
    - online purchase - no receipt (card not present CNP)
        - credit card company doesn't accept the loss
        - business stuck with loss
- solution: encryption, authentication, spyware protection

#### 3. Overloading of Resources (DoS attacks)
- aka denial of service attacks
- overload server with fake transactions
- so busy that server can't handle all the requests
- very easy to do by using intelligent agents, but difficult to block
    - fake transactions hard to detect
    - identify source & block server
    - DoS sender switches servers
    - turns into an arms race
- Russian-Georgian war of 2008, attacked Georgian Central Bank, shut down central bank, had to move servers to the US to operate their banking system
- solution: filters, firewalls

## Integrity

## Privacy
- limiting access to information
- indirectly important because helps protect security and integrity
- also directly important:
    - privacy has psychological, strategic, and economic value

#### Psychological Value of Privacy
- personal information may be embarrassing to reveal
- web may be more private than physical world
- privacy-oriented businesses can be successful on the web
    - gambling, pornography
    - medical and legal advice
- privacy is your defense against social control
    - without privacy, no individual freedom for fear of embarrassment and social rejection
- embarrassment is the threat of social rejection, an effective social control tool
- institutions take away your privacy, which eliminates your individuality, and control your behavior
    - if you can't be separate physically, you can't behave differently for fear of rejection
    - orientation is when you change your high school identity to college identity
    - you can't even think differently, as in Stockholm Syndrome

#### Strategic Value of Privacy
- competitive strategy, military strategy, political strategy, negotiation strategy from adversaries
- actions
    - CIA used wireless spying on foreign embassies
        - keyboard strokes send EM waves
- words
    - authoritarian governments track your words and remove dangerous ideas from society
        - preemptive action before words become actions
        - 100 yrs ago Emma Goldman arrested in NYC for advocating birth control
    - in marketing, people who create and disseminate new ideas are called **opinion leaders**
        - influence other people
        - adventurous and more likely to try new things
        - removing opinion leaders is effective social control system because there are very few of them
    - social and political change requires privacy for ideas to develop
    - businesses can implement social control systems also
    - employers constantly spy on employee email
        - business secrets as excuse
        - courts say employees don't have privacy at work
    - interviewers check your Facebook page
        - people are afraid to post controversial ideas
        - they don't exist in the public domain anymore
        - economic pressure
        - businesses act as agent of government by enforcing the norms
- what if you could track people's thoughts
    - your readings and searches reveal your thoughts and plans
    - Blackboard observes your reading behavior and can accurately predict your grade
        - University of Illinois made readings stream-only and track how long students spend
    - you can get an accurate profile of thoughts and tendencies
    take preemptive action, build a thought control system
    - US Patriot Act of 2006 controversial
        - allow government access to library and web surfing records
        - last year, Senate passed a law allowing ISPs to collect web browsing data and sell it

#### Economic Value of Privacy
1. your transactions reveal your price preferences
    - if you can keep your information private, you can prevent price discrimination
    - price discrimination by airline reservation systems and auctions
2. your time and attention are valuable
    - you can sell it if you claim ownership to it and protect it, but that requires privacy
    - direct marketers attempting to grab your attention without payment
    - TV and newspaper ads paying for your attention
    - time and attention of consumers are often free public goods
    - utilization skyrocketed with telephone and email technologies (used to be costly to take advantage)
    - utilization of a resources is determined by its cost and benefit, but some costs are incurred by others than those who are benefited
        - **negative externalities** are costs incurred by others, not those receiving the benefits
        - physical goods with negative externalities
        - any kind of pollution (air, water, water, noise)
    - goods with negative externalities tend to be over-utilized, beyond what is optimal for society
        - someone else is paying the cost, so people use as much as possible
        - often leaves everyone worse off
        - products where markets fail
        - _retaliation_: everyone else will take advantage, resource becomes unusable
        - widespread over-utilization by everyone
        - government regulation or technology to prevent overuse is useful
    - sensor technologies are promising to either block overuse as in spam filters or to charge over-users as in pollution control systems
3. information about is valuable
    - you can sell it if you claim ownership to it and protect it, but that requires privacy
    - shopping cards paying for information about you
    - on the web, you often reveal that information freely
    - Google purchased ad company Double Click in 2008 and formed alliance with startup SilverPush in 2016
        - 1. what you do on the web: Double Click collects click stream data, using cookies, from all affiliated sites
            - **multisite tracking** through affiliates
        - 2. who you are: Double Click collects demographic data from purchases, subscriptions, surveys, games, and community registrations, and link to your clickstream **identity tracking**
        - 3. what you do in the physical world: Double Click acquired Abacus Direct, combining online data with Abacus' offline transaction data from department stores, airlines, hotels, car rental companies
        - 4. what you do at home: SilverPush uses ultrasound messages, inaudible to human ears, to link devices in the same physical location and track them together **multichannel tracking**
        - a website ad or tv ad can communicate by ultrasound with a nearby phone or tablet if phone or tablet has app affiliated with SilverPush
        - link tells them if and how long the ad was watched, what other devices the watcher is using, what he was doing on them **cross device tracking**
    - produces a complete economic profile from tracking consumer over many affiliated sites and stores
    - allows customized ads, and information, even if the first time you visit a specific site, by using multisite, multichannel, and cross-device tracking through all affiliated sites, channels, and devices
    - potential: customized ads - you only see relevant information perfectly tailored to you; no more irrelevant ads, new recs
    - cons: only see information tailored to manipulate you; if you are exposed to only one consistent message, your behavior can be controlled, just like cult members

## Security Technologies
### Site Security
- critical as businesses open up their internal systems to external constituencies
- EDI
- avoid revealing to everyone
- firewall technologies act as a gateway
    - separates freely accessible from restricted
    - monitors and controls access
    - **packet filters**
        - checks source and destination
        - block DOS attacks
    - **proxy servers**
        - check message contents and track the resources utilized
        - useful in maintaining security at resource level

### Transit Security
- travel over internet
- every server on path is security threat because of sniffer programs
- can be installed on any server with a court order or by employer with no court order
- Verizon & AT&T sued for installing sniffers without court order to inspect all international communication at request of government
    - Sprint refused
- 3 issues: loss, privacy, integrity
- **loss**
    - not a privacy issue
    - if lost, no one can read it
- **privacy**
    - message is only read by recipient and no one else
    - tools: electronic envelopes
- **integrity**
    - message integrity: message arrived correctly
    - sender integrity: sender identified correctly

## 5 Tools for Privacy and Security
- all based on encryption
1. symmetric keys
    - oldest encryption
    - multiply by key to produce ciphertext
    - divide by key to decode ciphertext
    - provides privacy, integrity
    - 2 problems
        - **spontaneity** - prior exchange of keys required, but needs to be kept secret
        - **scalability** - number of keys is a problem
        - N people need N(N-1)/2 distinct keys to communicate
        - effective solution for long-term trading partners
2. symmetric keys with central authority
    - symmetric keys exchanged with central authority
    - securely communicate with central authority
    - session key created by central authority and communicated to parties securely
    - parties communicate using session key
    - more spontaneous because you don't have to exchange keys with everyone but the central authority
    - reduces number of keys to N
    - central authority only good for local network
3. asymmetric keys
    - everyone has 2 keys
    - public key is published in directly
    - private key is secret
        - message encoded by one can only be decoded by the other
        - based on number theory, developed for internet
        - two numbers related but not computable from each other(impossible), but too difficult to compute
        - 437 = 19 x 23
        - for very large numbers, very difficult to compute the prime constituents
        - public key: 437; private key: 23,19
        - currently use 1024-bit numbers
        - US govt bans exporting encryption programs using keys > 128 bits
    - encode with public key, decode with private key
        - completely private, but anyone else can intercept message and replace it with public key
    - encode with private key, decode with public key
        - has integrity, but anyone can read the message
    - encode with sender's private key and recipient's public key; decode with recipient's private key and sender's public key
        - has both privacy and integrity
    - need 2N keys
4. asymmetric keys with digest(hash)
    - digest = number computed from message, using public formula, much smaller than message
    - if message changes, digest very likely to also change
    - sender computes digest, then encode with private key
    - still doesn't scale well
5. symmetric keys + asymmetric keys + 3-way handshake
    - only businesses have public/private key pairs
    - consumers don't have individual pairs
    - customer generates a random number, called session key, and communicates it to the business privately, encoded with the business's public key
    - can use symmetric key for secure communication just for that transaction or session
    - https protocol
    - TCP 3-way handshake

# Payment Systems
- transit security: has integrity and privacy
- enough security for payment

### Credit Cards
- 1 ---cc#---> 2 ---cc#/verify--> ccc <---payment--- bank1 ---pay---> bank2<br>
-                                     ----------------pay-----------------><br>
1: customer<br>
2: business<br>
ccc: credit card company<br>
- insecurities?
    - transit is secure, but nodes are not secure (customer # falsified)
        - credit card company takes the risk, may revoke your credit card, requiring ongoing relationship between customer and credit card company
    - false business is a bigger problem
        - try to steal credit card #
        - **phishing**
        - solution to phishing: **signature tool**
            - signed with bank's private key (sender integrity)
            - integrity enforcement verifies sender
            - public keys are published, can be monitored by all
        - public keys can be verified by third parties called _Certificate Authorities (CA)_
            - e.g. Verisign.com, ICVerify.com, Authorize.net, Better Business Bureau
- CAs publish valid web-address-public key pairs, encoded with their own private keys
    - anyone can read them by using the public key of the CA
    - **digital certificates**
        - can be attached to any website to verify corresponding public key
- _businesses never see credit card number_
    - encode the credit card number with credit card company's public key
    - business can't read, but can pass on for credit card company to read

- 1 ---cc#---> 2 <---verify--> ccc <---payment--- bank1 ---pay---> bank2<br>
-                                    --------------pay-----------------><br>

### Electronic Checking
- bypassing credit card company
- possible due to databases + networks
- advantage of credit cards over personal checks
    - auto small loans
    - insurance against fraud
    - universal acceptance
    - technology of universal acceptance
    - lucrative fee of 2-3% on every transaction (retailers dislike)
    - originally, cccs created their own network to provide universal connectivity (now provided by internet)
- advantage of checks over credit cards
    - peer to peer acceptance with no special merchant accounts or card readers
    - transaction costs are high with credit cards and paper checks (~5 cents/transaction)
    - medium costs with electronic checks (~2 cents/transaction)
        - no loan and insurance services provided, no paper processed
- bank1 ---form---> 1 ---check---> 2 ---deposit/confirm---> bank2 <---submit/transfer funds--- > bank1
- most banks provide electronic checking
- money is transferred between accounts using ACH interbank automated clearing house as in electronic billing by utility companies
- for periodic payments, authorize automatic payments, bypassing the check writing
- specialized checking
    - transaction costs are low (~1 cent)
        - no inter-bank clearing
        - Paypal, Venmo, WeChat Pay, AliPay, Popmoney
        - have an account; move money to bank account, but takes 1-2 days
        - phone-based systems
        - all require membership in the same organization

### Electronic Cash
- why do we still use cash?
- parking meters, taxicabs, laundromats, buses, foodtrucks
    - don't have infrastructure to process
    - transaction cost (high for credit card)
        - cheap services -> big cut
- low transaction cost with physical cash because no bank clearing
- cash is anonymous
- electronic cash is signed by a bank rather than an individual
    - **electronic coins** for small denominations
    - no physical existence, leading to **double spending problem** if same person allowed to spend same coin repeatedly
    - clearing and cancelling is necessary to avoid double spending
        - same serial number can't be used again
        - large database of spent coins, cost of clearance
    - transaction cost is **medium**, because of inter-bank clearance, as opposed to **low** with physical cash
    - **not completely anonymous**
        - two banks can share info to figure out who spent the money and where
- serial number and denomination, signed by bank
- bank1 ---coins---> 1 ---coins---> 2 ---coins/new coins---> 2b ---spent coins---1b
- still experimental, most businesses are in bankruptcy
- not as useful as physical cash because it provides minimal anonymity, transaction cost higher than physical cash

#### electronic cash vs electronic checks
- your signature not on electronic cash
    - lose it, it belongs to whoever finds it 
    - anonymity provides no protection against loss

#### electronic cash vs physical cash
- physical cash circulates
    - electronic cash doesnot circulate and has to be cleared and cancelled as a spent coin after spending

### Anonymous Cash Technology
- nonsequential double-encoding
- encode a - encode b - decode b - decode a (sequential)
- encode a - encode b - decode a - decode b (nonsequential)
- envelope a - envelope b - open a - open b
- envelope a - sign b - open a - verify b
- 1 ---coins enveloped(key a)---> bank1 ---coins signed by bank(private key b) ---coins unenveloped(key a)---> 2 <---coins/new coins---> bank2 <---spent coins/funds---> bank1

#### Distributed Anonymous Cash: Bitcoin
- bitcoin replaces bank with distributed effort ot print money
- anybody can print bitcoins by investing computing resources **mining**
- new coins and spent coins are recorded not in banks but in multiple databases on the network in the correct sequence **blockchain**
- every person has a public-private key pair
- anyone can send you money by encrypting it with your public key, only you can read it with private key
- nobody can read it, sender can double spend, others can change it
    - sign it and distribute to multiple places, including sender as confirmation, to preserve integrity
- payment is recorded in multiple databases on the network simultaneously, so nobody can destroy it to prevent double spending
- weaknesses are also its ability to bypass government control and taxation
    - leaves money supply to the whims of ordinary people's ability to dedicate their computing power to mining

### Smart Cards
- much easier solution to anonymity
- hardware solution wiht complete anonymity with **smart cards**
- cards with money encoded in them **stored value cards**
1. anonymous
2. circulate
    - no double spending problem since chips are programmed to deduct any money you spend
    - no clearing
    - no spent coin databases
3. hardware devices more difficult to tamper with
4. can be used in physical world
5. **very low** transaction cost, since there is no clearing at all; lower than physical cost
    - physical cash requires physical proximity
    - card reader for smart cards
- only feasible payment system for very small transactions, under 10 cents, called **micro-payments**
- not feasible in physical world, due to transaction costs
- disadvantages
    - cards have to be printed and physically distributed
    - card readers have to be purchased and physically installed on each computer
    - long delays in adoption
    - high startup cost and strong network effects
- credit card companies excited
    - MasterCard successful in HK, but not in Europe/US
- Sony Suica and Edy (Japan), Octopus (HK), EZ-Link(Singapore)
- SKT (Korea)
- NTT Docomo Felicia (Japan)
- RFID or NFC tags - 4" w/o swiping
    - inserted into cell phones
- military created Eagle Cash, Freedom Pay
- AmEx Blue, Citibank/Chase smart card
    - failures due to strong network effects

## Significance of Payment Systems
1. impact all sectors
2. strong network effects
    - switching costs becuase of payment software, wallets, cards, and card readers have to be acquired by users and incorporated into business practices
    - network effects + switching costs = first mover advantages
    - difficult to replace credit cards in the US as primary payment system
3. create opportunities to reward your customers, and **punish the competitors' customers**
    - credit card companies charge retailers 2% to pay for rebate
    - retailers raise prices for taking credit cards
    - cash payers lose (no rebate)
4. **undermine government controls** of money supply
    - Federal Reserve: "electronic payment systems have the potential to disrupt money supply in the long run, but not currently"
    - critical arguments:
        - do not circulate: cleared every time they are spent
        - backed by the national currency; buy them with real dollars
    - Federal Reserve should regulate them if argumets do not hold
    - **no regulation of electronic money**
        - important factor of all technologies
    - when new technology emerges, there is a short time period (~6mo-1yr) to make lots of money due to lack of regulation
5. impact on money supply
    - Ithaca Hours privately printed currency
        - circulates, not backed by dollar, is legal
        - printing private currencies by private parties could create alternative currencies and disrupt the money supply
        - no regulation because the Fed thinks their impact is minimal, don't have national reach
    - it is difficult to regulate private IOUs
    - if person has trust, can print their own IOUS aka currency
    - on the internet, national reach
    - internet money
        - Beans
        - Ripple, not anonymous/purely transparent
            - private currency, also called dollars
            - everyone is creating money (extending credit)
            - low transaction costs
            - as long as there is a chain of connections, you can exchange credit with anyone
            - motivation to be an intermediary: can charge low transaction fees (only extending credit to trusted friends)
            - matches well with a social network platform
            - peer-to-peer banking system

## Component Systems
- payment systems have 3 components:
1. UI 
    - electronic checks, wallets, 
2. network and database connections 
    - post transactions to bank's database
3. computations
    - adjust balances and pay interest

### Computations
- objective is to minimize load on server
- server scripts (A2)
    - stored on the server, run on the server
    - I/O are transported to the client
    - large, complex, shared resource with small I/O
    - e.g. DB queries with ASPX docs
- client scripts (A3)
    - must be lightweight to be transported over the internet
    - interpreters have to be lightweight to be incorporated into browsers
    - small resource with much interaction/large I/O
    - e.g. animations, graphics, A/V
    - e.g. JS, VBS, AJAX (GMaps)
- mixed scripts
    - complex software, large scripts, extensive I/O require either complex software on the client or heavy traffic on the network
    - optimum solution is to split processing between the server and the client

## Application Service Providers (ASPs) and Cloud Services
- ASP/Cloud Services - business of running programs fully or partially on a remote server
- Cloud Services may not inclue just a specific application to use, but also a complete computing environment you can program and customize
- most execution is done on the server
- display and UI on the client
- useful business model
    - outsource complexity of IT to a specialized service
    - Amazon, Google, Oracle, Microsoft

### Software Rental
- ASP model allows you to rent software, charge for usage, instead of selling it
- running it on the ASP's server and the usage is easily trackable
1. **protects copyright** by running the software on the server
2. eliminates need to sell **new versions**
3. allows **price  discrimination** by separating heavy users from light users
    - optimal pricing system involves a fixed fee + an hourly usage fee
    - **two-part tariff**
    - reservation price of 4 customers: 4   6   8   9
        - revenues for price: 6        
        - maximum revenue:    18
        - \--
        - usage in hours:               2   3   5   6
        - price 2 + 1/hr
        - maximum revenue:              4   5   7   8 = 24
        - \--
        - prices for heavy/light users: provide pricing options
        - price options: by picking an option, users reveal their usage preferences
            - 1 + 1.5/hr
            - 5 + 0.6/hr
            - calculating optimal prices requires knowing reservation prices
            - irl, segment the market and estimate the reservation prices for groups of customers
        - revenue:                      4  5.5  8  8.6 = 26.1
        - can get very close to charging every user their exact reservation price
        - it become overwhelming to offer too many options
- insurance plans, phone/cable plans

### B2B communities
- extend ASP to proide compatible systems for B2B connections
- if you rely on ASP to maintin internal systems, you automatically have compatible systems with all customers of the same ASP
- allow member businesses to have ad hoc b2b transactions without prearrangements and long term commitments
- supply chain becomes integrated and flexible
- supply chain becomes a supply web, with multiple potential suppliers at any point
- some ASPs extending complete ecommerce environments
    - "plug and play" systems
    - new businesses have access to all the systems they need to run the business
    - standardized, ready to use, compatible with others in the community from day 1
    - Oracle inter-enterprise systems, HP Web Services, AWS, SAP
- difficult for single ASP to provide all systems necessary for interacting businesses
- centralized model creates monopoly and bottleneck
- decentralized model allows many ASPs to cooperate and provide compatible components

### **Web services**
- create marketplace of compatible and standardized software components that you search and combine to build your business systems
- easily switch between vendors for each component, eliminating high switching costs and lock in
    - new concept & interesting economic consequences
- counter to _first mover advantages_
    - standardized systems & components - eliminates switching costs/lock-in
    - network effects - access to the whole market
    - easy entry
- Second Mover Advantages
    - no first mover advantages
    - wait for someone else to take risks and fall
    - move in, imitate successful model
    - build similar business and standard components, without the risk of experimentation and failure
    - **second mover advantage**, created by easy entry and compatibility provided by web services
    - Samsung & Apple
    - stifles creativity, lead to economic stagnation; everyone waits for someone else to innovate
- solution to second mover advantage
    - business should not rely completely on standardized components from Web Services
    - some components, core competitive advantages should be internal to prevent imitation and second mover advantages
    - same issue with outsourcing

# Artificial Intelligence
- science of simulating human behavior in performing complex tasks
    - complex for humans  vs complex for machines
- 4 areas of study:
    - vision
    - language and speech
    - movement and robotics
    - reasoning and learning
- many business applications
- "complex tasks"
    - these tasks don't lend themselves to procedural, step-by-step solutions
    - _humans do not seem to know the complete procedure_
        - procedural description of walking is not obvious to humans
    - _developing machine procedures prove difficult_
        - vision, abstract analogies

## Vision
- recognizing physical objects
- automated security (FBI, airports)
    - facial recognition
    - handwriting recognition (USPS zipcode)
- assembly-line applications
    - MS research egg packaging system (cracked eggs)
    - consumer applications use cell phone cameras to recognize products and retrieve information
    - useful with shopping and museum applications
- driverless cars
- eye-movement tracking/detection
    - where you're looking
    - USAF, Eye Tribe

## Speech
- understanding (STT) and synthesizing speech (TTS)
- synthesizing speech is easier (machine already understands)
    - phone companies
    - MS bought Tell Me speech technologies for MS office
    - news anchors -> Ananova: speech synthesizing combined wiht animation as automated news anchor
    - customer representative at a web site
    - speech and animation useful for grabbing attention, directing and guiding customers
    - advantage over videos:
        - animations lighter load over the network
        - cheaper & less bandwidth
    - Pulse 3D
- understanding speech
    - difficult to hear
    - need to be able to convert sound to text (later)
    - dictation/typing automatically
        - Dragon Dictation Systems, MacSpeech by Nuance; require training
    - car hands-free applications: Ford Synch, Apple's Car Play, Navdy

## Robotics
- automated physical movement
- manufacturing: assembly lines and warehouses
    - assembling cars, tvs, computers, robot arms lifting, welding, painting and packing
    - Amazon's Kiva Robots in warehouse management
- automating hazardous work
    - space, underwater, at war, Japanese fire fighting robots
- aerial delivery and surveillance with drones
    - military, Amazon
- automating housework

## Reasoning and Learning Systems
- simulate decision making behavior of professionals
- perform specialized tasks
- diagnosing diseases in medicine
    - MYCIN Stanford - 30 yrs
    - PUFF UColorado - 20 yrs
    - EYE-CARE Rutgers (used in Egypt)
    - Isabel Healthcare - online diagnoser

- QA Systems
    - Siri, Cortana, Echo/Alexa, Watson, Google Home

## Tool
- **Artificial Intelligence Systems**
- **Rule-Based Reasoning** infers new rules
- **Case-based Reasoning** infers new cases
- **Machine Learning** infers relationships and rules from data

### Rule-Based Reasoning
- rule-based systems oldest and considered legacy systems
- huge collections of rules, where each rule s a condition-action pair
- if conditions are satisfied, actions are taken
- rules are relatively independent of each other, often entered by different people independently, with no explicit looping or sequencing
- system organizes rules, decides which ones to use when, and infers new rules
- many software products that provide these tools
    - e.g. P&G has a rule-based system to allocate advertising resources
        - CLIPS has 20k rules: economic conditions, forecasts, nature of product, past sales record, past advertising rules
        - no single formula or procedure; decision requires judgment
        - many rules of thumb can guide the decision
- **Bayesian Networks**: systems provide mechanism to compute confidence levels consistently using large scale application of Bayesian statistics
    - difficult to do calculate consistently when multiple paths and confidence levels

#### Bayesian Networks
- multiple paths that generate the same output at different confidence levels
- combine confidence levels as supporting evidence for hypothesis by using conditional probabilities

#### Rules
- when a rule's conditions are satisfied, it executes its actions "fire" (neurons)
- process of rules triggering each other generates new information, resulting in inferences
- difficulty to combine rules to draw reasonable conclusions, since rules are not all conclusive or consistent each other (merely guidelines)
- rules have confidence levels attached to them
    - add confidence levels using Bayesian analysis of conditional probabilities

### Case-Based Reasoning
- collect samples, and try to match new problems to existing cases by matching some of its attributes, and infer the missing attributes
- e.g. diagnosing human diseases from symptoms
- educate human professionals by using the same techniques
- similar to case-based education with examples, and we match new cases to existing examples
    - similar to teaching rules and formulas, and the conditions under which they apply

### Machine Learning
- creating and maintaining rules and cases are difficult
- systems derive rules directly from the data
- many different types
    - as simple as assuming a linear relationship among data and computing the most likely parameters **linear regression**
    - as complex as discovering all possible correlations among a set of variables, with no starting hypothesis **unsupervised learning**/**data mining**
        - statisticians dislike data mining because they assume correlations have a cause

#### Unsupervised Machine Learning
- computationally demanding because of huge number of correlations to test
- sheer computing power is growing and we can take advantages of correlations without hypotheses or understanding why
- typical example: retail data & basket goods
    - e.g. fraudulent transactions
- IBM Watson & QA system reads documents and computes co-occurrence frequency
    - now join with Apple and Johnson&Johnson and Medtronic to diagnose medical treatments and outcomes

#### Supervised Machine Learning
- create complex but incomplete model with many parameters, and then training it by providing feedback every time it fails, so it can update its parameters until it finds the right values
- when generic or nonlinear model, **neural networks**
- robots learning to walk
    - many iterations & trial and error

#### Caution
- when to use reasoning and learning systems
1. task should be complex, involving reasoning, judgment, and advice-giving, not straightforward procedure
    - not billing and payroll
    - tax advice to corporate clients, such as Expertax by PWC
2. task should not be too complex with little or no identifiable structure
    - should be some structure with recognizable experts who can partially explain them
    - can't predict new events -> statistics is useless
        - art: painting, music, poetry, raising a child
    - detecting credit card fraud, diagnosing diseases, designing computers
    - _semi-structured tasks_ are not appropriate for reasoning systems
3. task should be narrow
    - not involving broad human experience or common sense
    - not what we experience through our biological makeup
    - not paint, anxiety, fear, common sense, beauty
4. task should not be mission-critical, or the system should be supervised
    - they fail once in a while (rare failure creates false sense of security)

#### Failures are Common
- reasoning systems are _brittle at the edges_
    - works well for common cases, but unusual cases, fail dramatically (humans fail "gradually")
- humans compensate for lack of knowledge with common sense
- flower-recognition at Georgia Tech
    - 1. round bright colored center
    - 2.  long thin dull colored stem
    - 3. pointy protrusions of leaves
    - fails with puppy
- ping-pong playing robot at MIT's AI lab requires vision, robotics, reasoning

## Intelligent Agents
- AI systems on the internet
- 4 types:
    - search
    - notify and alert
    - advise and recommend
    - languages and speech

### Search Agents and Semantic Web
- "find me a digital camera under $300"
- database query vs search
    - database query is structured keywords and structured database
    - search engine for keywords to lookup in databases
- active research in building new Intelligent Web to accommodate intelligent agents, called **Semantic Web**
    - 1. utilize hash tags attached to text
        - similar to attribute names in databases or hash tags in Twitter
        - hierarchy of tags
    - 2. utilize functions attached to text to link them to other text
        - e.g. basketball players to their teams or player statistics
    - very different from hyperlinks
        - link to specific values, rather than complete documents, and they are labeled
- intelligent agents can follow links to discover information and respond to specific questions, rather than finding documents from keywords **QA Systems**
    - e.g. find digital camera under $300; basketball players who assisted in more than 10 pts in every game
    - follow tags and links
- shopping agents: roboshopercom, mysimon.com, bizrate.com, shopppin.com, streetprices.com, storerunner.com
- MS Pivot clusters information on multiple dimensions depending on their tags and functions
    - present clusters of information, rather than single web pages
    - introduce concept of similarity and distance to the Web, based on their tags and links

### Notify and Alert Agents
- "notify me when there is a digital camera under #300"; "let me know when the stock price of IBM goes below 80"
- repetitive/ongoing search
- generates a lot of network traffic and burdens seller servers
    - can easily mount a DoS attack
    - can set parameters on queries, including ask rate
- some businesses block out intelligent agents
    - unusual products/long tail customers
    - price-competitive sellers have advantage
        - price comparisons for ordinary items, but can't compare quality
- buyers may not benefit from Notify Agents at all, if sellers use them strategically
    - gives out information (e.g. price discrimination, price manipulation)
    - sellers can watch their competitors and match prices/discounts immediately
        - price-fixing collusion with competitors
