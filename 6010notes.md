# Introduction
- companies invest in IT to increase productivity
    - suggests capital to labor substitution
- **productivity** - output per employee per hour

## Productivity Paradox
**productivity paradox**: over 1975-1990, IT investment dramatically increasing, but productivity has been stagnant

### simple explanations:
1. measuring average productivity per employee (poor measurement)
    - some dramatically increase productivity while others' productivity drop
2. technology isn't used properly, can even be a distraction
3. time lag: delay in productivity increase
    1. training
    2. adapt tech for organization (customization), combined with secondary tech -> takes a long time
    3. adapt the organization to use IT (_business process engineering BPE_)

- optimal application of tech is between _ii_ and _iii_

e.g. electricity & redesigning factories ~ 40yrs
- estimating productivity delay is critical for high-tech companies
evidence: productivity shot up in 1990-1998, internet 2003-2016

### complex explanations:
1. time lag
    - evidence: time graph
2. misuse argument
    - for every business that uses IT properly gets a productivity increase, and two that don't
    - wasted effort -> no productivity, gains and losses cancel, average productivity doesn't change
    - may lead to more delay in productivity
    - also contributes to delay
        * companies that fail to integrate new technology take time to go out of business, which leads to increase of average productivity
    - evidence:
        - firm-level data
            * bimodal distribution of productivity
        - failures
            * 20% coporate IT projects fail within a year
            * more for startups and ecommerce
            * high variance suggests averages don't reflect productivity (self-reported is lower than actual failure)

investment into IT doesn't guarantee success

## Why is IT so complex?
Many techologies, and many tools for each

### Tool-Task Fit (Techology-Strategy Fit from organization perspective)
3 steps of fitting:
1. pick the right tool for the task
2. customize the tool for the task
3. reengineer the task for the tool
same reasons for delay in productivity

## Ecommerce is complex
Advantages
1. Reach: can reach more customers, over longer distances, at a lower cost, any time
    - lower customer acquisition cost
2. Richness: higher quality and complexity of information delivered to customers at lower cost
    - e.g. multimedia, customized product descriptions and recommendations
    - lower information deliver cost
3. Interactivity: form a stronger relationship with your customers
    - receive information back from your customers such as orders, reviews, preferences, and recommendations
    - lower information collection cost
    - #1-3 myths of electronic commerce
    - valid potential advantages, but very difficult to utilize
    - success in any 3 is rare
4. Ubiquity
    - consumers expend extra effort to reach traditional marketplace
    - marketspace is removed from temporal or geographic location
    - reduces transaction costs - cost of participating in market
    - reduces cognitive energy/mental effort to shop
5. Universal Standards
    - technical standards are universal
    - traditional commerce technology differs in each country
    - lower market entry costs (selling products)
    - lower search costs (finding products)
    - _price discovery_ faster, more accurate, easy to compare
6. Information Density
    - ecommerce tech reduces cost of
        - information collection
        - information storage
        - information processing
        - communication
    - increase currency, accuracy, timeliness of information
    - information is plentiful, cheaper, higher quality
    - price transparency, cost transparency
    - merchants can segment market, allowing for
        - price discrimination
        - cater to consumer preferences
7. Personalization/Customization
    - _customization_ - changing the delivered product or service based on a user's preferences or prior behavior
        - past purchases
        - browsing history
8. Social Technology
    - many-to-many model of mass communications
    - create, edit, and distribute content
    - social shopping and reputation

## Amazon
- successful in advantages 1-3
profitable?
- finally started making money in 2015-2016
- lost $1B over revenues of $3B in 2001
    - spent the money on advertisement
### transformation
books -> department store -> mall -> software and cloud services -> hardware: tablets -> streaming & content provider -> logistics & warehousing -> delivery -> grocery

- Amazon vs. Stone Soup in 1999
    * created a platform for selling items without providing any of the content
    * _intermediaries_ - facilitators of transactions between buyers and sellers
    * no physical processing, inventory, books, buildings, or significant physical existence
    * _infomediaries_ - intermediaries with no significant physical existence

## Constant Change as a Business Strategy
Why is constant change a good strategy good for IT business?
e.g. Google -> automobiles; Uber -> trucking; Apple -> music
1. Ease of Imitation
    - to prevent competitors from imitating, you create an arms race of technologies
    constantly build up on the lead that you hve
    e.g. Snapchat, iPhone, Bitcoin
2. Synergies between Technologies
    - there are shared components among many technologies
    - one the shared component is in place, expanding into new areas is cheap with high returns
    e.g. cloud computing by Google and Amazon, ebay & payment
3. Substitutability of Technologies
    - threats can come from anywhere, because there s substitutability among technologies
    - Google Search threatened by Facebook; search vs. social networks
    - "social shopping"
4. Fast-Changing Technology Environment
    - there is a fast-changing high tech environment
    - easy to become irrelevant quickly
    - similar problem with social institutions
        e.g. law, religion, government, education, family are designed to be rigid and inflexible
    - virtual instutions can explore the possibility of designing more flexible institutions using technology

## Impact of IT
- intense in 2 areas
- _intermediation_ - bringing buyers and sellers together to facilitate exchange of goods and services
    * _organizing_ and _coordinating_ efforts to produce goods and services
- _management_:setting goals, communicating goals, coordinating efforts to achieve the goals
- information intensive jobs require extensive communication and information processing
- IT is designed to support communication and information processing

## 2 Hypotheses
1. IT is the tool of trade for managers and ofen lead to new forms and styles of management
2. IT is a significant tool for intermediaries, and often leads to new types of intermediation
Questions: 
- What does IT do for managers and intermediaries?
- How can they adapt the technology to create a better fit for the organization?
- How do managers and intermediaries change themselves to take advantage of the technologies optimally?


# Communication and Conferencing, Virtual Corporation
- communication technologies provide simple examples for several complex concepts
    -tool-taks  fit, business processs reengineering
        * webcasting and conferencing: consulting, education
    - impact of IT on management
        * doc sharing, coordination
    - impact of IT on intermediaries

## Classification
- criteria: mode, content, scope

| _mode_ | example |
| - | - |
| synchronous | call |
| asynchronous | email (stored for your convenience) |

_content_: text, graphics, audio, video

| _scope_ | example |
| - | - |
| 1:1 | call, mail |
| 1:many | lecture, books/publications, web pages |
| many:1 | web transactions, mailboxes |
| many:many | group meetings |

#### 1:M synchronous with audio-video/broadcasting
- loudspeaker -> charismatic dictators (publci speakers)
- live TV -> looks/image
- Twitter -> short slogans
- _medium is the message_ - medium distorts the message
- same type of technology can result in different outcomes: charismatic dictators vs arab spring
    * -> ownership of technology is critical to impact
- cost:
    * synchronous tv broadcast expensive
    * webcasting drastically reduced cost

#### Drop in cost of technology often creates entrepreneurial opportunities
- parentwatch.com webcasting daycare, samething for pets
- education: distant learning

#### Asynchronous Education is even cheaper
- change education system to take advantage
- massive open online courses (MOOCs)
- _intelligent books_
- online education generally considered loewr quality
    - -> threatens lower level universities, but elitist universities may remain unaffected

| | benefits |
| - | - |
| asynchronous | anywhere/anytime/anyplace |
| synchronous | interaction |

#### Low Quality as a Competitive Strategy
- in technology business, lower quality and cheaper competition is a concern
    * with technologies that improve over time, low quality technologies can upgrade to mainstream, and high quality technologies become extravagant
- everyone's technology improves -> eventually the cheap option becomes good enough
    - high quality product may become less desirable, even at the same price
    - user experience - simple is better
- _disruptive technologies_ - often ignored by dominant firms as unprofitable
    - entry strategy, avoid competitive reaction, and slowly expand
- online education fits the model
- potential strategies to address these new entrants: ignore, buy out, direct competition

#### Optimum Design of Online Courses
- likely to become more of a production
- combination of synchronous & asynchronous
- parallel: music
- improvements: more interactivity, personal customization

#### Groupware and Consulting
- conerestone systems consulting co.: custom business software
-teams and client meetings via Cisco's Webex Conferencing
    - save time and money
    - place yourself closer to complex information and further from simpler information
- video not the most critical part; screensharing/document sharing extremely important
- _synchronous document sharing_: simultaneous viewing and editing of document by multiple users

#### Workflow Systems
- sequential document sharing, not synchronous, nor asynchronous
- automate supervision and control, electronically move documents & issue warnings
- e.g. paperwork

#### Managerial Implication of Control and Monitoring Tools
- use employee control and monitoring tools with care
- there is an optimum level of control to exercise
    - too little: no work done
    - too much: treating employees as robots doesn't take advantage of their skills

# Networks
**Metcalfe’s Law**, which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users
- doesn't apply to Uber/Lyft
- whoever has majority of drivers will slowly win

 # Networks
 **Protocols** - rules of navigating and sharing networks

- HTTP aka WWW, supports 1:M asynchronous communication
    - views wolrd as collection of docuents, each with address
    - address -> document
    - hypertext: text can be linked to more docmuents (nonlinear sequence of documents)
- email, telnet, FTP

### HTTP
- TCP
- IP: addressing
- client-server
- multiple layers bc developed at different times and served different purposes/"multi-purpose components"
- technologies change incrementally, allowing managers to anticipate if they know what to watch and follow the development
- technologies take a long time todevelop, commercialize, and even longer before widespread adoption

- 1948 Vannevar Bush: concept of WWW 1948 called Memex, manual system
- 1980s UMinnesota: Gopher, failed because no links, text-only, no GUI
- extremely expensive to maintain
- cost-based pricing too expensive in the beginning, incentivizes people to wait for cheaper price, no early users
- value-based pricing

### Network effects
- typical of networking and communication technologies
- product has positive network effects if the value of a product to a user increases with the total number of users (e.g. fax machine)
- value grows quadratically with number of users n^2^
- adds another cause for delay in adoption of technologies **in A1**
    - value of product is low in the beginning (before network is built)
- fax machine invented 1843, adopted in 1980s; 1st email 1969
- most companies can't afford long wait for return on investment
- *strategies to reduce delay:
    - free giveaways or introductory pricing
    - Tim Berners Lee invented WWW 1991 and gave it away for free because inferior product, inefficient, unreliable
- value-based dynamic pricing: multi-period analysis is necessary for the life of the product when there are network effects, because the price today effects the demand in the future
- consumers psychologically require stable price
- critical price point: free to charged
    - NY Times Online and 99c/month subscription fee
- bundling with an established product
    - e.g. IE, audio/video conferencing
- Google: search engine with learning algorithm: searchers
- _weak network effect_:
    - _fashion effect_ - fashion and reputation have weak network effects if they make your product more valuable
    - _watercooler effect_ - sharing/discussing the same content
    - _two-sided/indirect network effect_
        - online magazine: more readers -> attract better writers
        - Uber: drivers/riders
        - MS Windows: applications/users
        - Amazon: buyers/sellers
- if you need to exchange documents, likely to have network effects
- _economies of scale are not network effects, because they relate to cost, not value of the product_
- **first mover advantages** - once you achieve a critical mass, product is more valuable than competitors' products who are just starting to build their network
    - sustainable competitive advantage from size
- linear vs quadratic adoption rate
    - fatal implications:
        - overestimate demand in beginning (overproduction)
        - underestimate demand later (underproduction)
    - Corning Glass fiber optic 1990s almost failed until internet videos
    - railways in England 1800s: grew 20% annually, but traffic grew 4%; 1850s: railways grew 4%, traffic grew 20%
    - NY canal system 1880s
    - _Economist_: technological success but financial failure

# Databases and Electronic Markets
## Information Storage
Problems with Storage:

1. Dynamic Information: text documents difficult to update
2. Large Quantity: text documents waste space
3. Search and Filter: text documents are difficult to search
- complex questions
    - e.g. card holders w/ past due balances
    - e.g. purchsed camera in last month
    - e.g. cards used only when travel

- **fundamental problem**: accessibility
- inccessible -> difficult to use and analyze data

## Databases
store, search, retrieve, and update data efficiently
- every dept can collect and use own data

### Local vs. Shared Data
#### 1. decentralized and disconnected: duplicate storage in multiple databases
- multiple databases, redundancy
- issues:
    - redundancy, slow, _potential inconsistencies_

#### 2. decentralized and connected: store data where created and provide remote access
- multiple databases, no redundancy
- issues: 
- incompatibility between multiple databases
    - semantic: naming & unit conventions

#### 3. centralized but distributed: single organizational database
- centrally controlled pool of data with no redundancy or incompatibility
- can be geographically distributed
- _Data Model_ single central plan
- issues:
    - size problem/information overload: software solution
    - difficult to design single central plan for organization -> Database Management System (DBMS)
    - management problem: shared resources have to be managed and lead a political problems -> Database Administrator (DBA)

### Business Applications:
---
#### 1. Tracking Resources: transactions, inventory, organizational performance, processes and workflow systems
- freed _accounting_ from bookkeping via automation
- _transactions_ on same document (ordering, shipping, delivery)
- _inventory_ connected to registers, trigger reorder when supply below threshold
- _organizational performance_ manager can bypass line of command and get his own information from the database
    - information inconsistency vs overload -> stream the right level of information to corresponding level of management
- _traders_ filter & aggregate analysts' advice from database
- processes and **workflow systems** (systems that track processes): **concurrency**

#### Braess Paradox
network effects complicate centralization/decentralization debate further and require even more centralization to reach the global optimum

Leads to **Negative Network Effects**
1. centralize decisions
2. new technology can make everyone worse off, although each person will be better off

- When there are network effects, need to cooperate and centralize decisions -> industry standards and platforms; cooperation allows better outcomes

#### 2. 
#### 3.
#### 4.
#### 5.

## Web Retailers
earliest retailers: books computers, travel, brokerages
    - formally defined and information intensive products -> require extensive search
### Electronic Catalogs
- Sears
- advantages vs paper catalogs
    - cheaper - print & delivery, updates
    - easier to search, DBMS provides structure and language for search
- disadvantages vs physical stores
    - touch/feel products before buying
        - free returns or request detailed measurements
    - need web access
- most appropriate for fast-changing databases
- e.g. online stock trading, flight schedule, search engines
    - web crawlers, search engine optimization, spamming is possible with invisible keywords or manually submit keywords to search engines
- Physical stores have inventory, web stores have lower price
    - **free rider problem**: benefit from a good or service without payment because of lack of a market
    - web stores take advantage of services provided by physical stores; e.g. look at Best Buy, buy on Amazon

#### Potential Solutions
1. Physical stores also sell on internet, but doesn't reduce rent costs
    - charge less online -> lose own customers
    - charge same price -> lose customers to competitors
    - Web store as separate business - loses brand name
2. Charge for free service
    - car dealers lobbied lawmakers to require cars to be sold via dealers and not manufacturers
3. Add on services that online competitors couldn't provide (actual solution)
    - bookstores (community events, booksigning, cafe), furniture (interior design, delivery,  used furniture marketplace, repairs, cleaning), brokerage

**Most successful solution creates synergy between online and physical store**
- larger inventory online
- physical stores allow interaction with product but don't have to deliver
- buy online, pick up at store

Google as competition with Amazon
- collaborate with local stores: take dynamic inventory of small stores and connect with search engine capabilities to allow for quick delivery

### Direct Marketing
- result of database technology, directed at individuals at specific point in time
- keep track of individuals' purchases, allowing future purchase forecasting
- predict behavior via _profiling_ using demographic data and past purchases

### Relationship Marketing
- tracking customers over time and adjust to their changing needs
- database tech made tracking customers possible
- acquiring new customer 4x as expensive as tracking and keeping old customer
- **Hunter-Gather Paradigm of Marketing**: search for customers, locate them, sell, move on
- **Agrarian (Farming) Paradigm of Marketing**: cultivate customers, watch & grow over time, educate, anticipate needs, shape and create needs, protect and reward
- relationship marketing on the web necessary to compensate for lack of physical location or quality
- easier by tracking customer and not just their purchases
- cookies, identify information placed on customers' computers, determine when they come back and where they have been

### Location-Based Commerce
- tracking in the physical world
- track path with wireless transmitters and sensors, recommends products as you pass them
- **Location-Based Commerce**

### Gamification
- influence process of buying
- convert shopping process into game - **gamification**
- reveals information about customer and what is important to them, how much effort they are willing to put in

## Inter-organizational Systems/EDI/B2B SYstems
- Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) - inter-organizational systems on private networks
- B-B systems (business-to-business systems) - inter-organizational systems on public networks

organizational db deliver data to whole organization from a single source
- extend idea to multiple organizations

EDI allows entering transaction only once transaction is initiated
EDI: database to database communication of business transactions through db-web-db connection
- if encrypted and automatically commnicated to multiple databases for enhanced trust, called **blockchain**

advantages:
- reduce errors, inconsistencies, delays
- track resources in other organization
- concurrent task execution

?-db-web-dbb-?
- link transaction to internal systems at either end
e.g. link supplier and retailer
retailer: inventory control, automatic reorder systems
supplier: production-distribution systems

e-business

### Supplier Managed Inventory
- supplier acess internal systems of retailer
- Walmart-Proctor&Gamble alliance (retail link system)
    - P&G sales forecasts from Wal-Mart directly and in real time and adjusts production and distribution schedules
    - _just-in-time delivery_: minimize inventory to reduce cost but still get profits
- Dell-Intel alliance (e2open System)
- Colombia Drug Cartels
- Cisco Systems
    - business customers access Cisco's internal systems to configure networks, check for accuracy, completeness, price
     $3M investment, 800% ROI 1st yr, error rates dropped 30% - 0.3%

### Support Virtual Organizations/Virtual Corporations
- customization and tracking
    - e.g. students take courses at other schools
- resource sharing/specialization
    - e.g. course level competition
    - granularity of competition at course level, not just universities
- outsourcing and (becoming) virtual organization
    - e.g. eliminate unsuccessful courses and focus on core areas
- process improvement using big data
    - e.g. allow comparison data such as effectiveness

### Sharing Economy/Mom-tech
- virtualization allows resource sharing among individuals
    - uber, flycleaners, handy, blue apron, etc...
- social institutions
    - families mix and match services offered by others (customization and tracking)
    - specializing in tasks
    - outsource tasks
    - process improvement

### Supply Chain Integration
- chain of EDI connections support supply chain: retailer, distributor, wholesaler, manufacturer, parts supplier, parts manufacturer
- speed communication, reduce errors and inconsistencies
- perishable goods: grocery, fashion
- channel time from design to sale: 2010-36days, 2016-16days

### Problems
- 4 organizational issues

#### 1. Technical Complexity and Outsourcing
- make internal systems of every company compatible with each other's databases and internal systems
- building web infrastructure can be serious risk for older established companies
- **outsourcing complexity** with FedEx
    - FedEx + caliber logistics = virtual order
    - virtual order system is complete integrated logistics solution to physical logistics, information logistics, and payments
    - what is left?
- _be careful with outsourcing_ - no business left when everything is outsourced
    - keep core competence
- FedEx gets Silicon Valley Division of Texas Instruments - ideal client for virtual order
    - controlling entire supply chain is even better
- outsourcing complexity almost always reduce costs, but not long-term competitive advantage
     - competitors can also outsource
     - allows easy entry
    - _complexity creates barriers to entry_ - can become its own competitive advantage if done well

##### when to outsource complexity?
**market share vs market size** tradeoff
- outsourcing & industry standards causes costs and prices to go down
    - customers benefit, market expands
    - each individual has very small share of market (no competitive advantage)
- with most technologies, smaller share of larger market is often more desirable
    - -> outsourcing complexity pays off
    - network effects - size of market increases value of product
- Rule of Thumb: unless technology like EDI is your competitive advantage, you should support industry standards and outsource
- MS vs Apple over PC
    - Windows kept OS in-house & outsource hardware + software
    - Apple kept everything in-house
    - MS managed to build huge market & split with Intel, Dell, etc...
    - Apple built small market but kept all of it
- Google vs Apple over mobile
    - same strategies but Apple outsourced applications (network effects)

#### 2. Privacy
- retailer knows customers better than they know themselves
    - know competitors
- Amazon in 2002 shipped books only from Ingram Book Co.
    - keep customer information & relationship (brand recognition expensive)
    - advantage can easily be bypassed by stealing customers
- Ingram tried to have B&N buy them, stopped by US Govt (antitrust/vertical integration)
- privacy may prevent efficiency in the supply chain

- difference from Walmart/P&G
    - Walmart owns distribution (physical locations)
    - P&G is producer
    - Amazon only has customer information
    - Ingram has distribution

#### 3. Ownership and Lock In
- system to system coupling requires compatibility, expensive
    - Google merge local inventory
    - GE subsidizes suppliers' compatible systems
- **Lock In**: switching costs
- independent B2B markets
    - high potential
    - slow to establish - easy to fail (_network effects_)
- **Market Ownership**
    - network effect solution 1: can't be free bc compatibility expensive to build
        - B2B market has no value until integration issues are resolved 
    - network effect solution 2: need large players to build critical mass quickly
        - but they prefer to own the marketplace
    - big players monopoly/oligopoly collude, fix prices, manipulate demand; exploit small players
- _network effects + switching costs lead to monopolies_
    - network effects: can't get new customers
    - switching costs: can't steal customers
    - 1st mover advantage - need to be the first to build a critical mass
    - cooperate competitors and build industry standards, have a small slice of big market

#### 4. BPR
- EDI allows inter-firm coordination
- organizational processes have to be redesigned to take full advantage of inter-firm coordination
    - individual companies' systems are optimized for their specialties
- P&G/Walmart
    - eliminate backroom operations
    - P&G prepackage products to be placed on shelf
    - _supplier managed shelf space_
- Netflix's DVD business
    - don't re-shelf DVD
    - send it to the person who wants it next
    - need system to match DVDs with addresses
- UPS/HP
    - manufacturer -> UPS -> HP -> retailer
    - everything is delivered twice: combine assembly/delivery
    - assemble computers while parts are waiting during transport layover - moved assembly operations to airport hangar
    - cut $80 and 4 days
- BPR creates new business models in 3 steps
    - 1. networking and automated search (Netflix)
    - 2. resources sharing (HP)
    - 3. disintermediation (Walmart)
- 2 industry examples
    - taxi industry:
        - 1. Uber
        - 2. carpooling/car sharing
        - 3. community share cars (no driver)
    - music industry:
        - 1. download (iTunes)
        - 2. stream (YouTube/Spotify)
        - 3. ? match artist to consumers

### Information Logistics
database is warehouse, web is transportation
- 3 tools
    - Data Model: describe contents of database
    - Query Language: filter and retrieve data
    - Data Page: transport data from database to web users

#### Data Model
- central plan that describes contents of database
- **relational model** represents data in simple tables
- Table (File, Relation) for each entity type (flights)
- Row (Entity, Record) for each entity of a type (flight)
- Column (Attribute, Field) each attribute of interest for entity type
- Fill (Value)
<br><br>
- simplicity of model belies complexity underneath
- tables are not stored as tables
- extremely large - doesn't fit in RAM/hard drive too slow
- DBMS create and maintain data structures e.g. indices, catalogues
<br><br>
- database design involves defining data needs of organization in form of tables
- tables/relations have to be designed carefully to avoid duplication
    - redundancy -> wastes space, difficult maintenance, inconsistencies
- trivial redundancies: don't duplicate rows or columns
- some redundancies very subtle
- some redundancies are unavoidable
- split into another table
- design rule: put independent entity type in separate table
- same entity type over multiple tables introduces unnecessary jumping table to table

#### Query Languages & Queries
- query languages simple enough for user to interact with database without programmers
- SQL Structured (English) Query Language, industry standard for RDBMS
    - complete ( can access any information stored in the database)
```
SELECT  column names
FROM    table name
WHERE   condition to select rows
NOT IN  negative query
*
<>
DISTINCT
```
single-table
```
select flightno, destination
from flight
where origin='ny'
```
```
select distinct origin
from flight
```
multi-table
- convention: tablename.column
```
select flight.flightno
from flight, schedule, passenger
where flight.origin='ny'
    and flight.destination='chicago'
    and flight.price < 300
    and flight.flightno=schedule.flightno   // join condition
    and schedule.dtime < 900
    and flight.flightno = passenger.flightno    // join condition
    and passenger.name='Jones'
```
```
select flight.flightno
from flight
where flight.flightno not in (select passenger.flightno from passenger)
```
- _join condition_
    - jumping from table to another, carry condition
- inner query in parentheses
    - inner query evaluated first

#### Data Pages
3 tools:
- static data page (data on a web page)
- dynamic data page (automatically updated)
- interactive data page (customized)

Static Data Page
- manually carry response from query to web page
- cheap
- use when data doesn't change quickly
- limited use - takes work to update
- flights.html
db ---create page---> server (flights.html/data) <---request--- browser <--- request
                                                  ---deliver--- 

Dynamic Data Page
- flightd.aspx
- Active Server Page with XML
- more complex and expensive
- data is cached & need to refresh page/send another query when database is updated
- web page contains a program, not text (query)
update ---> db <---run query--- server (flightd.aspx/query) <---request--- browser <--- request
                --create page-->                             ---deliver--- 

Interactive Data Page
- necessarily dynamic data page + parametric queries
    - can't run query until received parameters from user
- flighti.aspx
- use forms to collect parameter values from users

## Multimedia
#### 1. text links
- text links (hyperlinks) to text, images, A/V, programs, links to other pages
- video on demand
- YouTube, Esquire, Amazon
- big data with video
    - index video segments to make them searchable, SPORTVU
- tagging and searching video segments
- feature films on demand: Netflix, Amazon, etc.
- DVD business - historical inertia: watching movie on big screen, poor network connection
- economics of online video:
    - broadcast TV: 0 marginal cost
    - on-demand online video: constant
- 5 Mbs x 10M watchers = 50Tbs = entire internet capacity
- _multicasting_: send one copy to a locality and distributing to all from there, but requests not synchronized
    - protocol (automatic), Akamai
- 2 solutions:
    - download ahead batch the requests to a locality
    - redundant permanent local storage
    - optimum is mix
- distribution of information is underestimated 
    - process is _similar to distribution of physical goods_
    - same strategies

#### 2. Dynamic Documents/Drill Down Documents
- dynamic documents link text to database
- [text -> db ->> text]
- automatically generate output text
- each step is easily manageable
- choices at each step narrow down the choices available in the next step
- reduce information processing by user
- Sabre was first airline reservations system (now Travelocity)
    - AA owns online flight reservation system market
    - control listings - AA flights show up first
    - see other airlines' transactions
- airlines tried to cooperate - Orbitz, sold to Expedia

#### 3. Drill Down reports (Executive Information Systems EIS)
- text -> db ->> stats, graphs ->> text, images
- reports contain derived data: processed, aggregated, summarized, analyzed
- drill down reports are characterized by repetitive queries
- how to provide information to top executives
- 4 characteristics:
    - _highly processed graphical_ output on dashboards (stats, graphs)
    - small chunks of information at each step, with a _drill down_
    - both the dashboard and the drill down are _personalized_
    - dynamic documents with up-to-date _real time_ information
- MIDS of Lockheed Martin (Management INformation and Decision Support)
    - 1000 _graphic_ displays as dashboards
    - each _personalized_ to meet the specific needs of an individual in real time
    - each _drill down_ capability into detailed _real time_ data
    - pushed to each executive's deck every morning
    - Bank One
- EIS leads to new stiles of management
    - allows more delegating, only deal with exception
- Google Analytics dashboard monitors effectiveness of website

#### 4. Image Links
- links from images to other documents

#### 5. Image Maps
- [image -> text, image]
- image maps from image to image repetitively
- Charts and and Maps
- Training
- table top computing w/ touch-sensitive screens
- potential to change restaurant, bar, library experiences

#### 6. Animation
- [image ->> image]
- browsing through series of images
- GIF animator by MS, ANFY animation library, Devolver animation tools
- full range human motion, full facial emotion
- Disney/Pixar, Dreamworks/Spielberg
- vision: replace acting with automated animations?

#### 7. Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- [image -> db ->> text,image]
- demographics overlaid on maps
- manipulating images of complex natural phenomena

#### 8. Visualization Systems
- [image -> db ->> stats,graph,simulation ->> text, image]
- similar to GIS but repeatedly manipulate graphics
- visualize complex multivariable relationships

#### 9. Virtual Reality
- direct manipulation of visual models in 3D
- main applications product design, architecture, gaming, increasingly finance
- Oculus, Sony
