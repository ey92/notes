## Productivity Paradox
	possible explanations:
	1. time lag
		evidence: time graph
	2. misuse argument
		- for every business that uses IT properly gets a productivity increase, and two that don't
		- wasted effort -> no productivity, gains and losses cancel, average productivity doesn't change
		- may lead to more delay in productivity
		- also contributes to delay
			companies that fail to integrate new technology take time to go out of business, which leads to increase of average productivity
		evidence:
			firm-level data
				bimodal distribution of productivity
			failures
				20% coporate IT projects fail within a year
				more for startups and ecommerce
				high variance suggests averages don't reflect productivity (self-reported is lower than actual failure)
	investment into IT doesn't guarantee success

Many techologies, and many tools for each

### Tool-Task Fit (Techology-Strategy Fit from organization perspective)
	3 steps of fitting
	1. pick the right tool for the task
	2. customize the tool for the task
	3. reengineer the task for the tool
