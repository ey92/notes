##productivity paradox 
possible explanations
	1. time lag
		evidence: time graph
	2. misuse argument
		- for every business that uses IT properly gets a productivity increase, and two that don't
		- wasted effort -> no productivity, gains and losses cancel, average productivity doesn't change
		- may lead to more delay in productivity
		- also contributes to delay
			companies that fail to integrate new technology take time to go out of business, which leads to increase of average productivity
		evidence:
			firm-level data
				bimodal distribution of productivity
			failures
				20% coporate IT projects fail within a year
				more for startups and ecommerce
				high variance suggests averages don't reflect productivity (self-reported is lower than actual failure)
	investment into IT doesn't guarantee success
