-----------------------------

mechanical power inverter
list price $50
$110M sales last year

wind power inverter
list price $90
$45M sales last year

insufficient sales support and advertising
insufficient R&D investment
	products are stale
high reject rate and increasing
high interest rate & low debt capacity
bad profitability

objective: maximize shareholder wealth through stock price appreciation
acting as management team, choose investments for high return
2 main strategies: low margin, high volume; high margin, low volume

market growth: 
	expand commercial sector and gain market share
	increase brand awareness
		ads, sales reps relative to other brands
		creates demand
		erodes over time
new market opportunity
	currently in commercial sector: MPI 110M, WPI 45M
	come into home energy sector: 75-90M

	solar power inverter: small market, high growth, less price sensitive
	already spent 5M on R&D on solar power inverter
	total expenditure on SPI must reach 20M before introduction

R&D effect:
	investment in innovation
	cumulative - doesn't erode over time
	relative to competition
investment limit:
	depends on sales revenue
	limit displayed on simulation
how to increase output:
	add a 3rd shift (currently 2 shifts 625ea), hiring and layoff costs
	schedule overtime max 15% shift
add capacity:
	expensive 900K fixed cost, lag time 1 yr
lower reject rate:
	natural increase of 2% per year
	investment in process improvement
	each 1M decreases reject rate by 1%, starts getting expensive to lower reject rate after 5%
	limit on simulation
overall borrowing limit
	interest rate depends on credit rating (at least BB)
sell stock
	$7/share
	limited to 20% of existing share
repurchase stock
	limited to 5% of shares outstanding
bank overdraft
	very high interest
	basically, dont run out of cash
