## Intro
**language** is a system of rules mapping sounds/gestures and meanings
- mostly compositional
- idioms noncompositional

**grammar**
- descriptive grammar (observations)
- prescriptive grammar (guidelines how to contruct phrases)
- mental grammar

**morpheme**: "minimal strings of sounds associated with fixed meanings"
- may be words, but they may be smaller than words
-connection between sounds of a word and its meaning is mostly arbitrary
except
	* onomatopoeia
	* sound symbolism

sound instead of writing: humans have had language from the beginning 50,000yrs
- only literate about 5,000yrs
- infrequency of developing independent writing systems
- -> writing not central to language
- graphical way of representing sounds

representing sounds in writing
- no 'th' letter - multiple sounds for 'th'
- many letters have multiple sounds
- why use 2+ letters to represent sound?

**International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)**
- 1888
- phonetic alphabet with characters having simple, consistent sounds, based on the Roman alphabet
- one sound per character
- one character for every sound used distinctively in some language
- advantage of universality

**acoustic phonetics**: analysis of speech sounds in their physical aspect
_spectrograms_ produce graphs(_spectographs_) which map the _frequency_ (pulse/second) and intensity (_amplitude_) of vibrations over time


## Phonetics 28/1
### Design features of language
---
- open-ended due to compositionality
- rule-governed
- mental grammars are generative
- rule-governed creativity -> understand new sentences; potentially infinite set of linguistic objects
- at each level, you can look at the objects that make up language from two different perspectives
	* **paradigmatic relationships** - what the chunks are, what categories they belong to
	* **syntagmatic relationships** - how they are put together (order, which ones work together)
- rules of grammar create 2D objects
	* language has linear order
	* but also hierarchical structure
- at level of sounds
	* phonetic features -> sound segments -> segments -> syllables, feet
	* **morphemes**: strings of sounds associated with fixed meanings, combine to form words usually ordered one after another
	* **free morphemes** - can stand by themselves as words
	* **bound morphemes** - can only occur in combination
- **word** - a free morpheme with all the bound morphemes attached to it
	*can a word be only made from bound morphemes?
- words -> phrases -> sentences

languages are learnable


### Phonetics
---
**articulary phonetics** - looks at the way sounds are formed in the hman vocal tract
- "high-front vowel /i:/" vs "high-back vowel /u:/" vs "low vowel /a:/"
- physical position in mouth

**acoustic phonetics** - concerned with physical analysis of the speech sound
- _sound spectrogram_ (waveform) time x frequency
- _formant_ - uniform band of relativeley great intensity in the sound specturm over a particular frequency range

**perceptual phonetics** - concerned with the mechanisms of speech perception in the ear and the brain
- physical distrubances of air vibrating ear

separate from grammar: describes the physical/physiological phenomena outside the speaker's mind


### Consonants & Vowels
**consonants** involve some degree of obstruction of airflow
- **stop consonants** completely cut off airflow (hear consonant when air is released): t,g,b,p,m
	* on spectrogram: blank/d
- **fricative consonants** restrict airflow enough to create turbulence: f,v,th
**vowels** do not obstruct airflow but more concerned about the shape of the mouth

_semivowels_ /j/ /w/ phonetically (articulatorily and acousitcally) vowels /ɪ/ /ʊ/

Classifying Sounds
- egressive pulmonary sounds - begine with airflow from lungs
	* airflow passes through the larynx and ca be modified by vocal cords in larynx

larynx is dangerously close to esophogus opening
- protected by epiglotties
- gives more room to articulate more sounds

voicing
- **vocal bands** - two muscular folds inside larynx which vibrate with each other when close together
- **voiced sounds** - sounds articulated with vocal cords
- **whispering**: holding back part of vocal cords apart
- **glottal stops** - created by momentarily closing the vocal cords

#### Articulatory Phonetics
- stop
- fricative
- affricate
- voice (glottal gesture & vocal folds)

glottal stops
- not written in English, implied by phonology of words
- glottal fricative: [h]
- not possible to voice glottal stops

vowels are normally voicedconsonants may or may not be voiced

voiced sounds can be made loud or soft, or sung

Voice Onset Time
-if voicing coincides with the release of the consonant, consonant is voiceless
-_voiceless aspirated stops_
	- sometimes, voicing is delayed after the consonant is released, while vocal records are apart
	- shows up as friction on spectrogram

advanced voice onset 	/d/
coincident voice onset 	/t/ 		only occurs after fricatives
delayed voice onset 	/t^h/ 		doesn't occur after fricatives

nasal soound: velum is lowered

dissimilation: r-> get switched

Airstream Mechanisms
- glottalic sounds: air pressure builds up between glottis and articulator
	- egressive: ejectives; amerind, african, caucasian languages
	- ingressive: implosives; rare, found in some american, african, south asian language
- lingual sounds: air pressure from moving tongue
	- ingressive: clicks; only in khoisan languages of southern Africa and southern Bantu (Xhosa, Zulu)
- sibilants - special type of fricatives
	- high frequency
	- /s z ʃ ʒ/
- groove (sibilants) vs slit fricatives (th)
	- tongue shape

Secondary Articulations
- vocal tract is restricted articulations (co-articulations)
- labialization		kʷ
- palatalization	kʲ
- velarization		ɫ
- pharyngealization
- glottalization

Great Vowel Shift

parameters for vowels:
- part of tongue raised
- height of tongue
- position of palate (nasalization)
- lip position (round/spread)
- tenseness
- length (supersegmental)

-English frotn vowels are always unrounded, back vowels always rounded
- diphthongs are vowels plus glides
	- bit, beet 	[ɪ, i]
	- bet bait		[з, e]
	- pull, pool 	[ʊ, u]
	- 1st vowels are short and lax
	- 2nd vowels are long and tense, tending strongly towards dipthongization

Phonetic Features tend to be binary
- [ʊ] [+V, -C, +back, +high, +round, -tense]
- [n] [+C, +stop, +apical, +voice, +nasal]

typical languages have more than twice as many consonants as vowels
| language | consonants | vowels |
| -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Haida (Amerind) | 46 | 3 |
| Powaian (Indo-Pacific) | 12 | 10 |
| English | 24 | 11-13 |

Universal Implications
- in general, languages hae more 'marked' (unusual) sounds only if they have more 'unmarked' (usual) sounds
	- p -> k
	- k -> t except Hawaiian
	- g -> d
	- d -> b
	- m -> n
- relationships mirrored in frequency of sounds in languages
	- /n t d s/
	- /sh ts zh/
	- [ʃ tʃ dʒ ʒ]. 
- nasal iff oral stops
- voiced iff voiceless stops
- front rounded vowels iff back rounded vowels
- relative ease of pronunciation
- vowel systems tend to be symmetrical
