## Intro
**language** is a system of rules mapping sounds/gestures and meanings
	- mostly compositional
	- idioms noncompositional

**grammar**
	- descriptive grammar (observations)
	- prescriptive grammar (guidelines how to contruct phrases)
	- mental grammar

**morpheme**: "minimal strings of sounds associated with fixed meanings"
	- may be words, but they may be smaller than words
	-connection between sounds of a word and its meaning is mostly arbitrary
except
		* onomatopoeia
		* sound symbolism

sound instead of writing - humans have had language from the beginning 50,000yrs
	- only literate about 5,000yrs
	- infrequency of developing independent writing systems
	- -> writing not central to language
	- graphical way of representing sounds

representing sounds in writing
	- no 'th' letter - multiple sounds for 'th'
	- many letters have multiple sounds
	- why use 2+ letters to represent sound?

**International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)**
	- 1888
	- phonetic alphabet with characters having simple, consistent sounds, based on the Roman alphabet
	- one sound per character
	- one character for every sound used distinctively in some language
	- advantage of universality

**acoustic phonetics**: analysis of speech sounds in their physical aspect
_spectrograms_ produce graphs(_spectographs_) which map the _frequency_ (pulse/second) and intensity (_amplitude_) of vibrations over time

### Design features of language
- open-ended due to compositionality
- rule-governed
- mental grammars are generative
- rule-governed creativity -> understand new sentences; potentially infinite set of linguistic objects
- at each level, you can look at the objects that make up language from two different perspectives
	* **paradigmatic relationships** - what the chunks are, what categories they belong to
	* **syntagmatic relationships** - how they are put together (order, which ones work together)
- rules of grammar create 2d objects
	* language has linear order
	* but also hierarchical structure
- at level of sounds
	* phonetic features -> sound segments -> segments -> syllables, feet
	* **morphemes**: strings of sounds associated with fixed meanings, combine to form words usually ordered one after another
	* **free morphemes** - can stand by themselves as words
	* **bound morphemes** - can only occur in combination
- **word** - a free morpheme with all the bound morphemes attached to it
	*can a word be only made from bound morphemes?
- words -> phrases -> sentences
languages are learnable

### Phonetics
**articulary phonetics** - looks at the way sounds are formed in the hman vocal tract
	- "high-front vowel /i:/" vs "high-back vowel /u:/" vs "low vowel /a:/"
	- physical position in mouth
**acoustic phonetics** - concerned with physical analysis of the speech sound
	- spectrogram (waveform) time x frequency
**perceptual phonetics** - concerned with the mechanisms of speech perception in the ear and the brain
	- physical distrubances of air vibrating ear
separate from grammar: describes the physical/physiological phenomena outside the speaker's mind

#### Consonants & Vowels
**consonants** involve some degree of obstruction of airflow
- **stop consonants** completely cut off airflow (hear consonant when air is released): t,g,b,p,m
	* on spectrogram: blank/gap
- **fricative consonants** restrict airflow enough to create turbulence: f,v,th

Classifying Sounds
- egressive pulmonary sounds - begine with airflow from lungs
	- airflow passes through the larynx and ca be modified by vocal cords in larynx

larynx is dangerously close to esophogus opening
- protected by epiglotties
- gives more room to articulate more sounds

voicing
- **vocal bands** - two muscular folds inside larynx which vibrate with each other when close together
- **voiced sounds** - sounds articulated with vocal cords
- **whispering**: holding back part of vocal cords apart
- **glottal stops** - created by momentarily closingthe vocal cords
