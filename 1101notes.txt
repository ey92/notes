language is a system of rules mapping sounds/gestures and meanings
	mostly compositional
	idioms noncompositional

grammar
	descriptive grammar (observations)
	prescriptive grammar (guidelines how to contruct phrases)
	mental grammar

morpheme: "minimal strings of sounds associated with fixed meanings"
	may be words, but they may be smaller than words

connection between sounds of a word and its meaning is mostly arbitrary
except
	onomatopoeia
	sound symbolism

sound instead of writing - humans have had language from the beginning 50,000yrs
	only literate about 5,000yrs
	infrequency of developing independent writing systems
	-> writing not central to language
	graphical way of representing sounds

representing sounds in writing
	no 'th' letter - multiple sounds for 'th'
	many letters have multiple sounds
	why use 2+ letters to represent sound?

International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
	1888
	phonetic alphabet with characters having simple, consistent sounds, based on the Roman alphabet
	one sound per character
	one character for every sound used distinctively in some language
	advantage of universality

acoustic phonetics: analysis of speech sounds in their physical aspect
spectrograms produce graphs(spectographs) which map the frequency (pulse/second) and intensity (amplitude) of vibrations over time
