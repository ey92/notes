### Truffle Hound: On the Trail of the World's Most Seductive Scent, with Dreamers, Schemers, and Some Extraordinary Dogs - Rowan Jacobsen
The most common truffles are black winter (French) and white (Alba) truffles. But there are many more less
popular truffles that could be much more affordable for different scents.

Truffles are mycorrhizal fungi who cultivate relationships with various trees and plants, often
near rivers or limestone. They help young trees retain nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen
from the soil in exchange for plant-produced sugars. Cultivated truffles often start with tree
saplings inoculated with truffle mycelium. It is difficult to inoculate mature trees since the
truffle will have to compete with existing fungi.

White/Alba/Italian truffle - _tuber magnatum_ $$$$$
- like tanned moon rocks, knobby smooth-skinned, pink prosciutto-like marbling
- size: marble to softball size
- season: October-December
- climate: river forests near sand, oak, poplar and willow trees
    - northern and central Italy east to Black Sea, around limestone
- never cook, infuse fats and eggs and then grate raw over hot, steamy dishes/broths/cream sauces
- scent: sharp, intense garlic, fried cheese, gym socks

Black/Winter/Perigord truffle - _tuber melanosporum_ $$$$
- black, firm, surface covered in pyramidal bumps, black/white marbling
- size: golf ball to baseball
- season: November-February (North), June-August (South)
- climate: under oaks and hazelnuts, 95% farmed
    - limstone-rich soils from eastern Spain, southern France, northern/central Italy
    - cultivated in ESP, FRA, ITA, AUS, NZ, CN, Israel, Turkey, Suth Africa, Chile, US
- good raw, but gentle heat brings flavors out
    - longer shelf life (weeks)
- scent: deep earth and forest, cocao and cognac, layers of tobacco, sorghum, cured olive
    - slow-matureing truffles have rich brandy/sherry scent

(black) Summer/Scorzone truffle - _tuber aestivum_ $$
- black and warty outside, marbled ivory inside, very firm
- keylime-sized, can get large
- season: summer-fall
- climate: hill forests, alkaline soil
    - Europe to Caucasus, farmed
- less popular for fancy eating, usually used for making packaged truffle product

    - popular until white truffles are in season
- use like black winter, but use more
- scent: delicate, floral, boiled corn, fried hazelnuts
- same species as summer truffle, but darker interior and stronger aroma due to environmental factors
    - cooler climates (higher altitude or latitude) makes them ripen later, building more aromatics

(white-ish) Bianchetto/Spring/Spring White/March/Marzuolo truffle - _tuber borchii_ $$$
- darker than white, ginger-root-like skin, interior like cured beef
- ounce to half-pound size only

- alkaline soil under oak and hazel
- climate: wild in Europe, turns up in black winter orchards
- cook with fatty meat, at the end; heat reduces tarry notes
- scent: alcohol, tobacco, firearms; tarry, earthy, smoked beetroot
- indesirable due to being used as substitute for black winter, but not necessarily worse

(white) Oregon white truffle - _tuber oregonense_ $$

### How to be a Conscious Eater - Sophie Egan
- tap water > bottled water
- ewg on washing fruit:
    - top pesticide residue: strawberries, spinach, apples, grapes, tomatoes, bell peppers, pears, cherries,
    potatoes, nectarines, kale (in general if you eat the surface)
    - lowest pesticide residue: asparagus, eggplant, cauliflower, pineapples (in general if you peel the
    surface)
- eat seaonally and regionally, the food will be fresher and more flavorful
- grains:
  - *intact* - retain all three parts (bran, germ, endosperm) and are intact, not processing (rolled is ok)
  e.g. brown rice
  - *refined* - bran and germ are removed, giving longer shelf life and finer texture (e.g. white rice, white
  flour)
  - *enriched* - refined + fortified
  - whole grains are still carbs and take longer to cook than refined grains, but they retain much more
  nutrients and more flavor
  - wholegrainscouncil.org
- fiber is good everywhere; sources: whole grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables
- Rice is by far the most exposed to arsenic. Wash and cook with extra water. Other grains are mostly fine.
- fruit sugars (fructose) don't spike insulin as badly due to time it takes to break down fruit cells. This
process is skipped when drinking juices directly.
- fat: polyunsaturated > monounsaturated > saturated > trans fat
    - poly: fatty fish, whole grains, seeds, vegetable oil
    - mono: avocado, olive oil, nuts
    - saturated fat: butter, animal fat, dairy, red meat
    - trans fat: hydrogenated oils, margarine, shortening
- milks: nut milk is a pretty good alternative to dairy, but lower in vitD and B12
    - top plant milks: almond, flax, nut milk
    - soy milk good, but low on vitD and B12
    - coconut milk has more saturated fat, rice milk high in calories and low in nutrients
- cooking oils: in general olive oil is a good choice
    - evoo good for cooking and dressing
    - sesame oil also good for cooking but $$$ and strong flavor
    - canola oil is good for cooking, higher smoke point
    - palm oil is just bad all around
    - coconut oil generally worse - 6x saturated fat, can use in place of butter for baking
    - more processed -> lighter color, less flavor
- with plenty of food fraud, it's easy to verify your food by buying it whole
- grassfed beef certifications:
    - `American Grassfed`
    - `PCO Certified 100% Grassfed`
- Greenpeace has an annual retailer scorecard "Carting Away the Oceans" that ranks sustainable seafood for
wild and farmed products
- wild vs farmed seafood: wild >> farmed in sustainability _and_ nutrition
    - farmed salmon + tuna is WORSE - fed corn and land animal leftovers, destroys local habitat
    - farmed bivalves are OK - mussels, clams, scallops, oysters
    - farmed seafood on water farms using recirculated water over land is OK
        - arctic char, catfish, tilapia, trout, cobia
    - farmed seafood country of origin:
        - Chile has tons of antibiotics
        - Norway barely uses antibiotics
    - Thai shrimp industry questionable
- seafood nutrition:
    - omega-3s from fish: EPA, DHA - recommend eating 2x a week
        - good sources: salmon, sardines, mussels, Atlantic mackerel, anchovies, sablefish/black cod
    - mercury accumulation: king mackerel, marlin, orange roughy, shark, swordfish, tilefish/golden
    snapper/golden bass,  bigeye tuna
    - alt sources of omega-3s (smaller concentrations): chicken, eggs, beans, nuts, seeds provide
    alpha-linoleic acid, precursor to DHA, EPA
- sustainable fishing certifications:
    - `Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)` (wild)
    - `Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC)` (farmed)
    - `Responsible Fisheries Management (RFM)` - Alaskan Seafood Marketing Institute
        - recognized by Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative (GSSI) based on UN guidelines
        - non-profit
- cholesterol - fat-like substance part of cell membranes and protects nerves, produce hormones and vitD
    - blood cholesterol vs dietary cholesterol
    - blood cholesterol: LDL, HDL, comes from eating fat and sugar
    - dietary cholesterol (animal-based food only), not actually impactful on blood cholesterol unless diabetic
- eggs
    - high vitamins, low calorie, very low saturated fat, some unsaturated fat
    - shell color and size doesn't matter (breed)
    - dietary cholesterol, vitamins, minerals in yolk, whites are low calorie, fat-free, high protein
    - labels
        - useless: `natural`, `all-natural`, `fresh`, `farm-fresh`, `united egg producers certified`,
        `antibiotic-free`
        - `no hormones`: required by law
        - regulated meaningful labels: `animal welfare approved`, `certified humane raised and handled`,
        `no antibiotics`, `certified organic`
            - `Global Animal Partnership (GAP) certified`
                - step 1: no cages, crates, overcrowding
                - step 2: enriched environments that encourage natural behaviors
                - step 3: enhanced outdoor access
                - step 4: pasture-centered
                - step 5: animal-centered and no physical alterations
                - step 5+: animal-centered, no growth hormones, no animal by-products
        - unregulated but has meaning: `cage-free`, `free-range`/`free-roaming`, `pasture-raised`,
        `vegetarian-fed`, `omega-3s`, `raised without antibiotics`, `no antibiotics administered`,
        `no antibiotics ever`
- processed meats linked to cancer (if you eat a 6 bacon strips a day)
    - aim to limit red meat to 3 portions (6oz cooked or 8oz raw) a week
- breastfeeding lowers breast cancer risk for lactating mothers and decreases cancer risk for children
(lowers chance of being overweight/obese)
- pthalates - endocrine disruptors interfering with hormones, found in plastics
- 2000 calories/day means:

        - trans fat: 0g
    - sodium: 1500mg
    - dietary fiber: 28g
- label distractions:
    - health halo - perceive product ot be healthier/lower calorie than it is
        - e.g. low-fat, gluten-free, veggie sticks
    - emphasizing some info to distract from other info
        - e.g. 0 trans fat, but tons of sat fat
    - functional claims `calcium builds strong bones`
        - not regulated
- ingredients are listed in descending order of quantity
- fuzzy meanings:
    - `reduced` means 25% less of something (sodium, fat) than original version
    - `natural` means does not contain any synthetic/artificial ingredients not expected in the food
        - allows natural flavors, which is synthetic
- caveats:
    - when something is removed, something replaces it to fulfill its function (texture, shelf life,
    flavor, color)
        - e.g. gluten: elasticity, binder - replaced with blood-sugar-spiking refined carbs tapioca/rice
        starch
    - fortified foods are not necessarily healthy
        - e.g. fortified grain - removed germ and bran and manually added back vitamins and minerals as
        "value-add"
- focus on the big picture, long-term
    - instead of low-calorie foods, think about the nutrients
    - 0-calorie soda is also 0-nutrient, and artificial additives are probably negative health effect
    - food is a way to form and maintain social connections; over-personalizing nutrition and avoiding foods
    makes it difficult to socialize
- artificial sweeteners are often much sweeter than real sugar - trains your palate to want something
sweeter than naturally sweet foods
- many "no sugar" products have sugar alcohols or artificial sweeteners
- too many products ~75% of packaged food have added sugars
    - cut added sugar in foods that have no business adding sugar - soups, condiments, juice, yogurt, bread
- rating restaurants
    - more nutritious fast casual: asian box, cava, chopt, sweetgreen, tender greens, zoe's kitchen
    - no antibiotics: shake shack, burgerfi, chick-fil-a, panera, chipotle
    - whole grains: au bon pain, bob evans, caribou coffee, chipotle, cracker barrel, dunkin donuts, pita pit, seasons52, starbucks, zoe's kitchen

        - ascorbic acid - vitamin C, preserves food color and flavor
        - citric acid - naturally in citrus fruit and berries, for tart flavor
        - modified food starch - commonly made from corn, wheat, potato, tapioca to achieve shelf life
        and stabilization and thickening
        - cellulose - plant fiber to prevent caking, boosts fiber content, but not as good as whole food fiber
        - tocopherol - vitamin E, prevents vegetable oils and cereals from turning rancid
    - sounds safe:
        - agave nectar - basically sugar, eat in moderation
        - sea salt - basically salt, eat in moderation
        - natural flavors - dunno, sometimes an allergen, avoid

    - usually replaced with bloodsugar-spiking refined flours
    - gluten-free often has more salt and sugar, less fiber
    - in many whole grains
- allergies
    - children born outside the US are less likely to have allergy
    - chance of having an allergy increases after 10 years in the US
    - hypothesis: antibiotics in food, limited exposure to outdoors
    - top 8: shellfish, eggs, fish, cow milk, peanuts, soy, tree nuts, wheat

    - less waste - portion sizes tailored to be satisfying and give the impression of providing value
- US food portions are significantly larger than food portions in the rest of the world and have grown since 1982
    - most pleasure form first few bites and last bite. Eating more doesn't feel better.

### The Omnivore's Dilemma - Michael Pollan
- bitter (grape, blueberry, broccoli, oregano) -> satiety
- fruity aroma increases perceived sweetness without extra sugar
- purple lettuce
- risotto: try carnaroli rice
- polyunsaturatedfat > unsaturated fat > saturated fat

**food seasonality**
- pork, beef: late fall/winter
- chicken, eggs: summer
    - eggs less yellow in winter
- asparagus: summer

industrialized food changes:
- "number 2 field corn" - not for human consumption
    - feed livestock, make food additives, make supplements, make containers
- industrialization -> monoculture -> biodiversity problems (toxic runoff, diseases)
- omega-6 (plant seeds):omega-3 (fish, pastured meat) should be 1:1
    - corn -> high omega-6 (inflammatory, blood clot)
    - non-corn-fed fish/pastured meat -> higher omega-3s (anti-inflammatory, blood flow) ALA, CLA

pasture farm
- free-range pastured hens produce orange yolk eggs due to better diet and exercise
- no waste
- fertilizes itself and magnifies production by "stacking" livestock "holons"
- spring/summer: grass -> cows / manure -> worms and parasites / chickens -> chicken poop / grass fertilizer
- racken house: rabits in suspended hutches, droppings into woodchips and corn (to ferment), chickens eating
earthworms on the ground
    - in spring, pigs dig and eat corn while aerating compost, decomposing waste into fertilizer

**omnivore's dilemma**
- we can eat so many things, but we need to eat multiple foods to be nutritionally complete
- neophilian and neophobia - stick to familiar foods, but also try alternatives if current food isn't enough

Not practical for every day, but it is a useful lesson to understand fully where everything in the meal came
from, as opposed to fast-food meal where you can't trace anything.

### The Dorito Effect - Mark Schatzker
Current food is less flavorful and less nutritious.

People like to reduce the problem to a single source - fat, or carbs, or sugar, or MSG/salt. Nutrition is
more complicated. Flavors are tied to different nutritious foods. Cutting one doesn't solve or fix the
imbalance. We associate flavors with a set of aromas, all associated with different chemicals from different
ingredients.

Dorito: Frito-Lay VP Marketing wanted to make new crunchy chip that mimicked taco. The appetizing
sound of the crunch and taco seasoning made it a success. Baked chip + chemicals (taco seasoning).

Dorito effect:
- dilution of nutrients
- nutritional decaptiation (we capture the flavor but not the nutrients)
- false variety: flavors provide different tastes laid over the same food/set of nutrtients
- cognitive deception - fake flavors make you what you want in real food
- emotional deception - establish liking for bad food
- flavor-nutrient confusion

Rules of flavor
1. humans are flavor-seeing. flavor is the pleasure provided by food
2. in nature, flavor and nutrition are intimately connected
3. synthetic flavor breaks and confounds that connection

Madagascar artificially raised vanilla price by reducing supply. Vanillin was created by processing pine
bark but the imitation was off due to missing other aromas. **Gas chromatography** was able to identify
all of the aroma compounds with a peak (magnitude). McCormick continuously ran new combinations of
chemicals through a flavor panel until it was indistinguishable.

*natural flavors* only refers to flavor chemicals that can also be made naturally. Does not made that the
particular batch used was naturally made.

In 1918, half pound of spices per person in US. In 1997, three pounds of spices per person.

Most restaurants don't cook or develop their dish's flavors. They provide a target experience and consult
flavor companies like McCormick to develop the flavors for them.

Julia Child complained chicken is to bland. Good chicken doesn't need more seasoning than just salt
and pepper. If you think about food sources and "agricultural revolution," it makes sense. Everything is
being diluted. Use the same-sized plot of land to churn 2x or more vegetables. A dairy cow in 1948 produced
16 pounds of milk daily, now 70 pounds. "Flavor solutions" fix the taste problem, but not the nutrition
problem.

Our food is becoming like livestock food. "Concentrates" or high-energy diets with high cabs and flavoring
(palatants). Livestock don't normally like just corn and grains. But we add palantants (flavoring) to it,
and it becomes tasty. Palatants are also used to wean baby animals earlier (4m -> 10 d). Like livestock,
we're growing faster. If we let them live out natural lifespans instead of slaughtering for food, livestock
also goes on to become obese, become afflicted with metabolic disease, hypertension, etc.

The human nutrition system is amazing in sensing and calculating needs if trained.
- Clara Davis baby nutrition study: Babies chose their own food among 34 natural foods for 6 months.
    - They develop preferences, like meat and milk protein over vegetable protein
    - There were unconventional combinations: liver and orange juice, eggs and bananas
    - They naturally chose balanced diets. No constipation, Colds no longer than 3 days, protein intake
    shot up when growing; when growing slowed and activity increased, energy intake shot up.
- Nutritional wisdom is learned. However, it can also learn the wrong thing. E.g. phosphorus and goats with
coconut vs maple. We can train our bodies to correctly or incorrectly associate flavors with the right nutrients.

**Plant Secondary Compounds**
Plants produce secondary compounds (polyphenols) for a multitude of purposes not directly related to survival. It could
attract bees for pollenation, or it could attract parasitic wasps to hunt caterpillars eating their leaves.
Generally, the more flavors, the higher density of secondary compounds. Prime example of well cultivated plant
that produces flavors tied to where it's grown: wine. We use spices for their secondary compounds as flavoring.
- some plant effects:
    - coriander inhibits pro-inflammatory mediator expression
    - ginger alleviates nausea nad vomiting, kills cancer cells, help blood pressure
    - dill: skin elasticity
    - basil - kill viruses, prevent inflammation, lower cholesterol
    - cinnamon - decrease blood glucose in Type 2 diabetes
    - black pepper - antidepressant, stimulate digestive tract
    - cloves modulate platelet activity
    - turmeric - preserve cognitive function, could be antiparasitic, carioprotective, anticancer

Some experts are working on cultivating fruit, vegetables and meat to bring flavor back while keeping yield up.
For some reason, industry isn't buying most of those options. We had several strange breakthroughs with
kale, arugula, chard.
- Harry Klee - Garden Gem tomato
- Douglas Hayes - Buckeye chicken
- Mark Taylor - Mayan Gold potato
- Chuck Brown - potato
- France - Label Rouge chicken (less fat, more protein, minerals, vitamins)
- David Griffin - various vegetables (sorrel, carrots, Chinese leaf lettuce, peppercress, tatsoi, radicchio, dill, kale, Amara mustard greens, basil)
- Ilya Raskin - Rutgers Scarlet Lettuce
- Ed Seguine - chocolate (cocoa) CATIE
- Bob Klein - from WSU Hollis wheat kernels and berries

**junk food**
- OED: pre-prepared or packaged food that has low nutritional value
- Merriam-Webster: food that is not good for your health because it contains high amounts of fat or sugar
- author: food that tastes like something it is not


## 9 September 2025
### The End of Craving - Mark Schatzker
carbs vs fat: body is nearly equally efficient at extracting and storing energy from either source

pellagra - in the American South and Northern Italy
diets were lacking niacin (vitamin B3)
US: enrich pasta, rice, cornmeal, grits with niacin
Italy: eat more rabbits (meat) and bread(yeast) and drink wine (yeast)

metabolism
pleasant temperature is what brings you back to desired temperature (bathtub experiment)
set points - metabolic pressure to avoid gaining/losing weight

fluorosis and niacin

wanting vs liking: dopamine signals cause animal cravings, not always pleasureable; achieving the goal is
less about pleasure and more about silencing the dopamine-induced craving
- gambling, eating, sex
uncertainty causes a spike in dopamine - an uncertain outcome is more exciting than a certain one,
regardless of good or bad

**nutritive mismatch**
Dana Small: chocolates have diminishing pleasure
- fake sugar study - multiple sugar waters mixed to present 75 calories of sugar's worth of sweetness, up
to 150 calories
- result: 75-calorie drink caused the most brain activity - matched the expected taste of 75 calories of
sugar sweetness
- conclusion: brain likes the drink where sweetness matches predicted calorie content

artificial everything:
- alginate - stabilizer, thickener, smooth texture; replaces eggs and cream
- sugar alcohols (xylitol, isomalt, maltitol) - cause diarrhea, twice as sweet, no calories
- fake fats (olestra) - zero calories, anal leakage
- Simplesse ("milk protein", "whey protein concentrate") - creamy, but not thick
- Slendid - high ester pectin - thickener
- bulking ingredients: Crystalean, Lorelite, D-LITE
- mouthfeel ("carrageenan"): Avicel, Methocel, Solka-Floc, Genutine, Genugel
- Creamfibre7000 makes water taste like fat
- modified starches: maltodextrin (fat, sweet)
- sucralose, gums, carrageenan, modified s tarches, methylcellulose, stevia, flavorings, saccarin,
microparticulatated protein, Solka-Floc, maltodextrins
- additives can be organic

food substitutions are everywhere, unreliable calorie predictions in our food -> "calorie casino"
loss aversion >> gain potential based on Tversky and Kahneman study

Sailors lacking nutrients in their diet were instinctually driven to eat new fruits that contain what they
need and found them tasty.

Rats that ate olestra chips half the time (uncertain calorie amount) ate more and got fatter
even if you avoid the calories by eating something with a 0-calorie substitution, most people go on to
make up the calories in their other foods, usually carbs.

pig feed study:
A: mixed fortified ration in drylot
 - highest weight
B: free choice corn/supplement troughs in drylot
 - 3rd in weight, preferred pasture alfalfa to supplement
C: mixed fortified ration on pasture
 - nutritionally complete food made them ignore pastures
D: free choice on pasture
 - same as before, lowest weight

Vitamin B chemicals: convert calories to energy. By enriching food with extra vitamin B chemicals, body is
suddenly able to process and store all the extra calories from the food. eating thiamin chloride stimulates
carbohydrate appetite
- thiamin: release energy from carbs
- riboflavin: release energy from ETC
- niacin: energy transfer reactions in metabolism of glucose, fat, alcohol
- carbs: glucose, dextrin, maltose, sucrose, fructose
- sucrose and fructose require 3x as much niacin to metabolize

The solution to silence "wanting" is to intensify the "liking". Anja Hilbert helps obese patients adjust behavior
by emphasizing the intense pleasure of enjoying one artisan chocolate over meaningless chips and other
binge-worthy junk food.

### A History of the World in 6 Glasses - Tom Standage

beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, coca-cola

Interestingly, the drinks either have alcohol or caffeine. They began as drinks that were a safe alternative to
water whose safety was questionable. First by fermentation, then by boiling water. It also follows the history
of humans from the first civilizations developing around settlements and reliable sources of food to consumable
currency, to fueling global trade (and slavery).

Another fun fact - Greeks and Romans diluted their wines with water

Coffee is from Arabia, and for a time Arabian merchants kept their monopoly by only selling roasted beans. The 
Dutch managed to smuggle a Mocha plant and developed plantations in Java. A cutting was given to Louix XIV, the
offspring of which Louix XVI had planted across the French colonies. English coffee houses hosted men of any class
and served as open centers of discussion for all topics. Different coffee houses became known for specific topics
(market news, scientific discussion, literature, etc). Newspapers, LSEG, auction houses, and insurance companies
came out of coffee houses. So much free information was available that they became known as penny universities.

The British didn't have a good supply to coffee or the plant, but they managed to defeat the Dutch navy, establishing
British supremacy at sea. The British East India company effectively had ownership of the Indian colony for a
few decades. They got green tea from China, but could not trade anything but silver in return. They illegally
sold opium (grown in India) to Chinese merchants, developing an addiction and market for a product to trade for
tea. Green tea was often adulterated, so black tea (oxidized leaves) became more popular, because it was harder
to tell and the additives were less bad. Black tea was more bitter, so they began adding milk (also to cool faster)
and sugar. Teahouses were open to women and Twinnings became popular for mixing custom tea flavors.

Coke started as a quack medicine, using cocaine from coca and caffeine from kola. Originally copied a french kola
wine and combined with fizzy water. Popped off due to temperance movement and dodged taxes and lawsuits due to
lucky timing. The drink has since removed cocaine and halved the caffeine content but otherwise remains unchanged
and continues strong association with American/Western values (followed WWI/II, Vietnam War, Cold War).

Other fun facts:
- hops were only added to beer in the 12th century to balance sweetness and as a preservative
- beer = hopped
- ale = unhopped, top-fermented
- lager = bottom-fermented
- bappir = baked beer bread, storable pre-beer ingredient sprouted barley baked into unleavened bread

Old-style beers:
- King Cnut Ale - St Peter's brewery
- Midas Touch - Dogfish Head Brewery
- Sahti - Finnish folk beer

Mas des Tourelles winery (southern France)
1. Mulsum - red herbs and honey; diluted tastes like Ribena
2. Turriculae - white, seawater and herbs, especially fenugreek; tastes like dry nutty sherry
3. Carenum - dessert wine - red mixed with defrutum and herbs; tastes like late-harvest Zin

Mastroberardino winery (near Naples)
1. Greco di Tufo - from the Greeks, white
2. Fiano di Avellino - 
3. Aglianico- used for Taurasi

- "Coffee, the sober drink, the mighty nourishment of the brain, which unlike other spirits, heightens purity and lucidity; coffee, which clears the clouds of the imagination and their gloomy weight; which illuminates the reality of things suddenly with the flash of truth." - Jules Michelet 1798-1874
- "You that delight in Wit and Mirth, and long to hear such News,
As comes from all parts o the Earth, Dutch, Danes, and Turks and Jews,
I'le send you a Rendezvous, where it is smoaking new:
Go hear it at a Coffee-house - it cannot but be true ...
There's nothing one in all the World, From Monarch to the Mouse,
But every Day or Night 'tis hurl'd into the Coffee-house." - Thomas Jordan "News from the Coffee-House" 1667

- "Thank God for tea! What would the world do without tea? How did it exist?" - Sydney Smith 1771-1845
- "The progress of this famous plant has been something very like the progress of truth; suspected at first, though very palatable to those who had the courage to taste it; resisted as it encroached; abused as its popularity spread; and establishing its triumph at last, in cheering the whole land from the palace to the c ottage, only by slow and resistless efforts of time and its own virtues." - Isaac D'Israeli 1766-1848
- "Stringer! stronger! grow the all,
Who for Coca-Cola call.
Brighter! brighter! thinkers think,
When they Coca-Cola drink." - Coca-Cola advertising slogan 1896
- "A billion hours ago, human life appeared on earth.
A billion minutes ago, Christianity emerged.
A billion seconds ago, the Beatles changed music.
A billion Coca-Colas ago was yesterday morning." - Robert Goizueta, CEO Coca-Cola Company, April 1997

## This is Your Mind on Plants - Michael Pollan
What a fun experiment. The author decides to explore three kinds of plants that represent the three types of effects 
they can have on the mind - opium (depressant), caffeine (stimulant), and mescaline (psychotic). How easy or hard
it is to access each, and in the case of caffeine, how we take their effects for granted in contrast with normal
daily function.
