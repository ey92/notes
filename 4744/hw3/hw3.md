#### Part E
No, it isn't licensed by my grammar, and no, it is intuitively possible.
- with square brackets grouping valid noun phrases: <br> `[people who [people who [people who people need] need] need] people`
- it is intuitively easy to understand the meaning in the smallest set of square brackets <br> `people who people need` <br> as a noun phrase
- replace that smallest noun phrase with another noun to find that it is still valid: <br> `[people who [people who [monkeys] need] need] people`
- keep replacing and it will be clear that the sentence is not a valid English sentence:
    - `[people who [monkeys] need] people`
    - `[monkeys] people`
- the sentence is missing a verb
