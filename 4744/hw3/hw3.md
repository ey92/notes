#### Part E
No, it isn't licensed by my grammar, and no, it is intuitively possible.
- with square brackets grouping valid noun phrases: <br> `[people who [people who [people who people need] need] need] people`
- it is intuitively easy to understand the meaning in the smallest set of square brackets <br> `people who people need` <br> as a noun phrase
- replace that smallest noun phrase with another noun to continue simplifying: <br> `[people who [people who [monkeys] need] need] people`
- keep replacing and it will be clear that the sentence is not a valid English sentence:
    - `[people who [monkeys] need] people`
    - `[monkeys] people`
- the sentence is missing a verb

#### Part A
`a^{m} b^{m}     m > 0` <br>
p4a.gram
```
1.0     S C'
1.0     C A' C B
1.0     C A' B
```
- make sure every iteration inserts one A and one B before and after the recursive component respectively

#### Part B
`a^{m} b^{n}     n > m` <br>
p4b.gram
```
1.0     S C'
1.0     C A' C B
1.0     C C' B
1.0     C B
```
- make sure recursive element ends on B
- allow recursive element to only produce A if there is also a B
- allow recursive element to allow addition of only B within iteration

#### Part C
`[a b]^{n}      n > 0` <br>
p4c.gram
```
1.0     S C'
1.0     C A' C
1.0     C B' C
1.0     C A'
1.0     C B'
```
- allow recursive element to add A or B
- force recursive element to end on A or B so string length is greater than 0

#### Part D
`a b+` <br>
p4d.gram
```
1.0     S A C'
1.0     C B' C
1.0     C B'
```
- force first production to start with A and never add A again
- recursive element only goes to adding any number of B
- recursive element must end with B to force at lease one B
